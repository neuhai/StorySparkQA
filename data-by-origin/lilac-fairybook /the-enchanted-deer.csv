That night he rose softly, and left the house carrying the gun with him.
'I will not stay here to be beaten,' thought he, and he walked and

fisher's son, and eat and drink while you may.' So he entered and found
food and wine on the table, but no man, for the house belonged to some
robbers, who were still away at their wicked business.

After Ian, the fisher's son, had eaten all he wanted, he hid himself
behind a great cask, and very soon he heard a noise, as of men coming
through the heather, and the small twigs snapping under their feet.

man, and he was as well as ever. By this time he did not mind what
befell him, so sure was he that the deer would take care of him, and
in the evening that which had happened before happened again--the four
robbers were put to death and the fisher's son also, but because there
was no food left for them to eat, they were nearly mad with rage, and

so hard that by and bye they were all stretched dead on the floor.

vanished into a wood.

Next day he set out for the church, but the old woman of the cottage had
gone before him, and had stuck an enchanted stick called 'the spike of
hurt' in a crack of the door, so that he would brush against it as he
stepped across the threshold. Suddenly he felt so sleepy that he could
not stand up, and throwing himself on the ground he sank into a deep
slumber, not knowing that the dark lad was watching him. Nothing could
waken him, not even the sound of sweetest music, nor the touch of a lady
who bent over him. A sad look came on her face, as she saw it was no
use, and at last she gave it up, and lifting his arm, wrote her name

determined that he would not go to sleep, whatever happened. But in his
hurry to enter he touched with his hand the spike of hurt, and sank down
where he stood, wrapped in slumber. A second time the air was filled
with music, and the lady came in, stepping softly, but though she laid

and the meat cooked, and a bag made of its red skin.
