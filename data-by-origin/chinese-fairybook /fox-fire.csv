1,"Once upon a time there was a strong young farmer who came home late
one evening from market. His way led him past the gardens of a wealthy
gentleman, in which stood a number of tall buildings. Suddenly he saw
something shining floating in the air inside the gardens, something
which glowed like a ball of crystal. He was astonished, and climbed
the wall around the gardens, but there was not a human being in sight;
all he saw was, at a distance, something which appeared to be a dog,
looking up at the moon. And whenever it blew its breath out a ball of
fire came out of its mouth, and rose to the moon. And whenever it drew
its breath in the ball sank down again, and it caught it in its jaws.
And so it went on without a stop.",25,garden,is used for,growing_flowers,Where do you grow your flowers?,I grow my flowers in the garden.

a fox, who was preparing the elixir of life. He hid in the grass and

strength. For this reason he did not dare attack him, but went angrily
on his way.",57,swallow,has subevent,chew,What do you do after you chew your food?,I swallow it.
