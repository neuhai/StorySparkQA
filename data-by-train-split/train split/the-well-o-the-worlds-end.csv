water.",84,brim,is a,edge,What is brim?,Brim is the edge of a container spout.

the cottage door. Then they heard a tiny little voice singing:

saucerful of milk.""",71,wet,is the antonym of,dry,What is the opposite of wet?,Dry.

slew my father. For long years I have lived in that well, the Well of the World's End, waiting for a maiden to appear, who should take pity on me, even in my loathsome disguise. She who would promise to be my wife, and who
would also have the kindness to let me into her house, and the courage, at my bidding, to cut off my head.""
