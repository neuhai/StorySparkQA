""Do not talk such nonsense! All the ogres were killed by our chief Raiko at Oeyama! It cannot be true, because even if any ogres did escape from that great killing they would not dare to show themselves in this city, for they know that our brave master would at once attack them if he knew that any of them were still alive!""

""Then do you disbelieve what I say, and think that I am telling you a falsehood?""

""No, I do not think that you are telling a lie,"" said Watanabe; ""but you have heard some old woman's story which is not worth believing.""

Stooping to pick it up he found that it was one of the ogre's huge arms which he must have slashed off in the fight.

Watanabe now began to grow uneasy as to how he should keep the arm in safety, for he knew that the ogre to whom it belonged was still alive. He felt sure that one day or other, as soon as the ogre got over his scare, he would come to try to get his arm back again. Watanabe therefore had a box made of the strongest wood and banded with iron. In this he placed the arm, and then he sealed down the heavy lid, refusing to open it for anyone.

""Then you cannot surely refuse to show me the arm any longer."" entreated the old woman; ""for it is the great wish of my heart to see for once in my life the arm of an ogre!""
