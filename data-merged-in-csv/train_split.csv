a-fish-story,1,"Perhaps you think that fishes were always fishes, and never lived
anywhere except in the water, but if you went to Australia and talked to
the black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country, you
would learn something quite different. They would tell you that long,
long ago you would have met fishes on the land, wandering from place to
place, and hunting all sorts of animals, and if you consider how fishes
are made, you will understand how difficult this must have been and how
clever they were to do it. Indeed, so clever were they that they might
have been hunting still if a terrible thing had not happened.",7,fish,is at location of,water,Where do fish live?,In the water.
a-fish-story,2,"One day the whole fish tribe came back very tired from a hunting
expedition, and looked about for a nice, cool spot in which to pitch
their camp. It was very hot, and they thought that they could not find
a more comfortable place than under the branches of a large tree which
grew by the bank of a river. So they made their fire to cook some food,
right on the edge of a steep bank, which had a deep pool of water lying
beneath it at the bottom. While the food was cooking they all stretched
themselves lazily out under the tree, and were just dropping off to
sleep when a big black cloud which they had never noticed spread over
the sun, and heavy drops of rain began to fall, so that the fire was
almost put out, and that, you know, is a very serious thing in savage
countries where they have no matches, for it is very hard to light it
again. To make matters worse, an icy wind began to blow, and the poor
fishes were chilled right through their bodies.

'This will never do,' said Thuggai, the oldest of the fish tribe. 'We
shall die of cold unless we can light the fire again,' and he bade his
sons rub two sticks together in the hope of kindling a flame, but though
they rubbed till they were tired, not a spark could they produce.",5,tribe,is a,social_group,What is a tribe?,A group of people forming the social network.
a-fish-story,3,"'Let me try,' cried Biernuga, the bony fish, but he had no better luck,
and no more had Kumbal, the bream, nor any of the rest.

'It is no use,' exclaimed Thuggai, at last. 'The wood is too wet. We
must just sit and wait till the sun comes out again and dries it.'
Then a very little fish indeed, not more than four inches long and the
youngest of the tribe, bowed himself before Thuggai, saying, 'Ask my
father, Guddhu the cod, to light the fire. He is skilled in magic more
than most fishes.' So Thuggai asked him, and Guddhu stripped some pieces
of bark off a tree, and placed them on top of the smouldering ashes.
Then he knelt by the side of the fire and blew at it for a long while,
till slowly the feeble red glow became a little stronger and the edges
of the bark showed signs of curling up. When the rest of the tribe saw
this they pressed close, keeping their backs towards the piercing wind,
but Guddhu told them they must go to the other side, as he wanted the
wind to fan his fire. By and by the spark grew into a flame, and a merry
crackling was heard.",222,wind,is made of,air,How do the wind form?,With the difference in air pressure.
a-fish-story,4,"'More wood,' cried Guddhi, and they all ran and gathered wood and heaped
it on the flames, which leaped and roared and sputtered.

'We shall soon be warm now,' said the people one to another. 'Truly
Guddhu is great'; and they crowded round again, closer and closer.
Suddenly, with a shriek, a blast of wind swept down from the hills
and blew the fire out towards them. They sprang back hurriedly, quite
forgetting where they stood, and all fell down the bank, each tumbling
over the other, till they rolled into the pool that lay below. Oh, how
cold it was in that dark water on which the sun never shone! Then in an
instant they felt warm again, for the fire, driven by the strong wind,
had followed them right down to the bottom of the pool, where it burned
as brightly as ever. And the fishes gathered round it as they had done
on the top of the cliff, and found the flames as hot as before, and that
fire never went out, like those upon land, but kept burning for ever.
So now you know why, if you dive deep down below the cold surface of
the water on a frosty day, you will find it comfortable and pleasant
underneath, and be quite sorry that you cannot stay there.",224,dive,has subevent,hold_breath,What should you do when you dive?,You should hold your breath.
a-french-puck,1,"Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France
there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit. It was this spirit's delight to play
tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys.
They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself
into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed,
there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a
needle. At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as
he might he never was able to imitate the hole. Every woman would
have found him out at once, and this he knew.

Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will
call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight. This was just when the
shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound
asleep. Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that
fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang
to the ground. The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the
cowboys, however fatigued they might be. They dragged themselves
wearily to the stable to put back the chains. But no sooner had they
returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on
till the morning. Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting
together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take
the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning. Puck,
hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying
himself amazingly all the time.",153,prank,is a,joke,What is a prank?,A prank is a practical joke.
a-french-puck,2,"One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing
along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating
loudly. William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he
had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner. So
he went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it
could hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on
his way. The sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and
staggered along as best he could under his load.

'It is not much further,' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue
of walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and
made him jump.

'Where are you?' said the voice, and the sheep answered:

'Here on the shoulders of a donkey.'

In another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and William was
running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him. But as he
went, a laugh, which yet was something of a bleat, rang in his ears.
Though he tried not to hear, the words reached him, 'Oh, dear! What fun
I have had, to be sure!'",79,hoist,is used for,lift_things,What does it mean to hoist?,To hoist means to lift things.
a-french-puck,3,"Puck was careful not always to play his tricks in the same place, but
visited one village after another, so that everyone trembled lest he
should be the next victim. After a bit he grew tired of cowboys and
shepherds, and wondered if there was no one else to give him some sport.
At length he was told of a young couple who were going to the nearest
town to buy all that they needed for setting up house. Quite certain
that they would forget something which they could not do without, Puck
waited patiently till they were jogging along in their cart on their
return journey. He changed himself into a fly in order to overhear
their conversation.

For a long time it was very dull--all about their wedding day next
month, and who were to be invited. This led the bride to her wedding
dress, and she gave a little scream.

'Just think! Oh! how could I be so stupid! I have forgotten to buy the
different coloured reels of cotton to match my clothes!'

'Dear, dear!' exclaimed the young man. 'That is unlucky. Didn't you
tell me that the dressmaker was coming in to-morrow?'

'Yes, I did,' and then suddenly she gave another little scream, which
had quite a different sound from the first. 'Look! Look!'",218,dressmaker,is capable of,cut_cloth,What do dressmakers do?,Cut cloth and make clothes for women.
a-french-puck,4,"The bridegroom looked, and on one side of the road he saw a large ball
of thread of all colours. All the colours, that is, of the dresses
that were tied on to the back of the cart.

'Well, that is a wonderful piece of good fortune,' cried he, as he
sprang out to get it. 'One would think a fairy had put it there on
purpose.'

'Perhaps she has,' laughed the girl. As she spoke she seemed to hear
an echo of her laughter coming from the horse, but of course that was
nonsense.

The dressmaker was delighted with the thread that was given her. It
matched the stuffs so perfectly, and never tied itself in knots, or
broke perpetually, as most thread did. She finished her work much
quicker than she expected and the bride said she was to be sure to come
to the church and see her in her wedding dress.

There was a great crowd assembled to witness the ceremony. The young
people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood, and their parents
were very rich. The doors were open, and the bride could be seen from
afar, walking under the chestnut avenue.",224,avenue,is a,street,What is an avenue?,An avenue is a broad street.
a-french-puck,5,"'What a beautiful girl!' exclaimed the men. 'What a lovely dress!'
whispered the women. But just as she entered the church and took the
hand of the bridegroom, who was waiting for her, a loud noise was heard.

'Crick! crack! Crick! crack!' and the wedding garments fell to the
ground, to the great confusion of the wearer.

Not that the ceremony was put off for a little thing like that! Cloaks
in profusion were instantly offered to the young bride, but she was so
upset that she could hardly keep from tears. One of the guests, more
curious than the rest, stayed behind to examine the dress, determined,
if she could, to find out the cause of the disaster.

'The thread must have been rotten,' she said to herself. 'I will see if
I can break it.' But search as she would she could find none.

The thread had vanished!",16,whisper,is a,speaking,What does it mean to whisper?,To whisper means to speak in a quiet voice.

was written: ""Son of the Watercrystal you are destined to become an

there on the floor stood two shoes of red silk, whose tips were

a-legend-of-knockmany,1,"It so happened that Finn and his gigantic relatives were all working at
the Giant's Causeway in order to make a bridge, or, what was still
better, a good stout pad-road across to Scotland. Finn, who was
very fond of his wife, Oonagh, took it into his head that he would go
home and see how the poor woman got on in his absence. So accordingly he
pulled up a fir-tree, and after lopping off the roots and branches, made
a walking-stick of it and set out on his way to Oonagh.

Finn lived at this time on Knockmany Hill, which faces Cullamore, that
rises up, half hill, half mountain, on the opposite side.

The truth is that honest Finn's affection for his wife was by no manner
of means the whole cause of his journey home. There was at that time
another giant, named Far Rua--some say he was Irish and some say he was
Scotch--but whether Scotch or Irish, sorrow doubt of it but he was a
targer. No other giant of the day could stand before him. Such
was his strength that, when well vexed, he could give a stamp that shook
the country about him. The fame and name of him went far and near, and
nothing in the shape of a man, it was said, had any chance with him in a
fight. Whether the story is true or not I cannot say, but the report

This quieted Finn's heart very much, for he knew that Oonagh was
hand-and-glove with the fairies. Indeed, to tell the truth, she was
supposed to be a fairy herself. If she was, however, she must have been
a kind-hearted one, for by all accounts she never did anything but good
in the neighbourhood.

Now, it so happened that Oonagh had a sister named Granua living
opposite to them, on the very top of Cullamore, which I have mentioned
already. This Granua was quite as powerful as herself. The beautiful
valley that lies between the Granlisses is not more than three or four
miles broad, so that of a summer evening Granua and Oonagh were able to
hold many an agreeable conversation across it, from one hill-top to the
other. Upon this occasion Oonagh resolved to consult her sister as to
what was best to be done in the difficulty that surrounded them.

""Granua,"" said she, ""are you at home?""

""No,"" said the other, ""I'm picking bilberries at Althadhawan"" (the
Devil's Glen).

""Well,"" said Oonagh, ""go up to the top of Cullamore, look about you, and
then tell us what you see.""

""Very well,"" replied Granua, after a few minutes; ""I am there now.""

""What do you see?"" asked the other.

""Goodness be about us!"" exclaimed Granua, ""I see the biggest giant that
ever was known coming up from Dungannon.""

""Ay,"" said Oonagh, ""there's our difficulty. That's Far Rua, and he's
comin' up now to leather Finn. What's to be done?""",52,scrape,has subevent,roll_up,What does it mean to scrape?,Roll up.

plan to get yourselves out of the scrape. But,"" she proceeded, ""I'm
short of butter, having in the house only half a dozen firkins, and as
I'm to have a few giants and giantesses to spend the evenin' with me I'd
feel thankful, Oonagh, if you'd throw me up fifteen or sixteen tubs, or
the largest miscaun you've got, and you'll oblige me very much.""

""I'll do that with a heart and a half,"" replied Oonagh; ""and, indeed,
Granua, I feel myself under great obligations to you for your kindness
in keeping him off us till we see what can be done; for what would
become of us all if anything happened to Finn, poor man!""

She accordingly got the largest miscaun of butter she had--which might
be about the weight of a couple of dozen millstones, so that you can
easily judge of its size--and calling up her sister, ""Granua,"" says she,
""are you ready? I'm going to throw you up a miscaun, so be prepared to
catch it.""

""I will,"" said the other. ""A good throw, now, and take care it does not
fall short.""

Oonagh threw it, but in consequence of her anxiety about Finn and Far
Rua she forgot to say the charm that was to send it up, so that instead
of reaching Cullamore, as she expected, it fell about half-way between
the two hills at the edge of the Broad Bog, near Augher.",63,firkin,is a,british_capacity_unit,What's firkin?,It's a British capacity unit.

or injure you!""

And, sure enough, there it lies to this day, with the mark of the four
fingers and thumb imprinted on it, exactly as it came out of her hand.

""Never mind,"" said Granua, ""I must only do the best I can with Far Rua.
If all fail, I'll give him a cast of heather broth, or a panada of oak
bark. But, above all things, think of some plan to get Finn out of the
scrape he's in, or he's a lost man. You know you used to be sharp and

you, or you'll outdo Far Rua yet.""

She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill, after which she put
her finger in her mouth and gave three whistles, and by that Far Rua
knew that he was invited to the top of Cullamore--for this was the way
that the Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers to
let them know they are welcome to come and take share of whatever was
going.",218,whistle,is a,high_pitched_sound,What's whistle?,It's a high pitched sound.

or how to act at all. Far Rua was an ugly customer, no doubt, to meet
with; and, moreover, the idea of the confounded ""cake"" aforesaid
flattened the very heart within him. What chance could he have, strong
and brave as he was, with a man who could, when put in a passion, walk
the country into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes? The
thing was impossible, and Finn knew not on what hand to turn him. Right
or left, backward or forward, where to go he could form no guess
whatever.

""Oonagh,"" said he, ""can you do anything for me? Where's all your
invention? Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes and to
have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe, and me the
best man among them? How am I to fight this man-mountain--this huge
cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt--with a pancake in his
pocket that was once----?""

""Be aisy, Finn,"" replied Oonagh. ""Troth, I'm ashamed of you. Keep your
toe in your pump, will you? Talking of pancakes, maybe we'll give him as
good as any he brings with him--thunderbolts or otherwise. If I don't
treat him to as smart feeding as he's got this many a day, don't trust
Oonagh again. Leave him to me, and do just as I bid you.""",80,passion,is a,emotion,What's passion?,Emotion.

then drew the nine woollen threads of different colours, which she
always did to find out the best way of succeeding in anything of
importance she went about. She then plaited them into three plaits, with
three colours in each, putting one on her right arm, one round her
heart, and the third round her right ankle, for then she knew that
nothing could fail her that she undertook.

they were done. She then put down a large pot of new milk, which she
made into curds and whey, and gave Finn due instructions how to use the
curds when Far Rua should come. Having done all this, she sat down quite
contented waiting for his arrival on the next day about two o'clock,
that being the hour at which he was expected--for Finn knew as much by
the sucking of his thumb. Now, this was a curious property that Finn's
thumb had; but notwithstanding all the wisdom and logic he used to suck
out of it, it could never have stood to him here were it not for the wit
of his wife. In this very thing, moreover, he was very much resembled by

nights in which they went hungry to bed became more and more frequent.

Now one evening the king of that country was hunting near the
charcoal-burner's hut. As he passed the door, he heard a sound of
sobbing. Being a good-natured man he stopped to listen, thinking
that perhaps he might be able to give some help.

are, ready to work like slaves the whole day long, and no work can we

'I!' replied somebody.

'And who is ""I""?'

'The king. Let me in.'

Full of surprise the woman jumped up and pulled the bar away from the
door. As the king entered, he noticed that there was no furniture in
the room at all, not even a chair. He pretended to be in too great
a hurry to see anything around him, and only said 'You must not let me
disturb you. I have no time to stay, but you seemed to be in trouble.
Tell me; are you very unhappy?'

'Oh, my lord, we can find no work and have eaten nothing for two days!'
answered she. 'Nothing remains for us but to die of hunger.'

be so ungrateful as to disobey you, when you are so kind?'

The king smiled, and his eyes twinkled.

'Well, let us start at once,' said he. 'Lock your door, and put the key
in your pocket.'

The woman looked as if she thought this was needless, seeing it was
quite, quite certain they would never come back. But she dared not say
so, and did as the king told her.

After walking through the forest for a couple of miles, they all
three reached the palace. By the king's orders, servants led the
charcoal-burner and his wife into rooms filled with beautiful things
such as they had never even dreamed of. First, they bathed in green
marble baths where the water looked like the sea. Then, they put on
silken clothes that felt soft and pleasant. When they were ready, one

could scarcely bring themselves to take them off. Their dinners were so
good that they found it very difficult to leave off eating. Then outside
the palace were gardens filled with rare flowers and fruits and singing
birds. If they desired to go further, a golden coach, painted with
wreaths of forget-me-nots and lined with blue satin, awaited their
orders. Sometimes it happened that the king came to see them. He
smiled as he glanced at the man, who was getting rosier and plumper each
day. But when his eyes rested on the woman, they took on a look which
seemed to say 'I knew it,' though this neither the charcoal-burner nor
his wife ever noticed.

'No, never,' replied the man. 'It is no affair of ours,' and the
conversation dropped once more. As time went on, the woman spoke
less and less, and seemed so wretched that her husband grew quite
frightened about her. As to her food, she refused one thing after
another.

'My dear wife,' said the man at last, 'you really must eat something.
What in the world is the matter with you? If you go on like this you
will die.'

'I would rather die than not know what is in that tureen,' she burst
forth so violently that the husband was quite startled.

'Is that it?' cried he; 'are you making yourself miserable because of
that? Why, you know we should be turned out of the palace, and sent away
to starve.'

'Oh no, we shouldn't. The king is too good-natured. Of course he didn't
mean a little thing like this! Besides, there is no need to lift the lid

hold of the handle of the cover and raised it very slowly and carefully,
while the woman stooped down to peep. Suddenly she startled back with a
scream. For a small mouse had sprung from the inside of the tureen, and
had nearly hit her in the eye. Round and round the room it ran. Round
and round they both ran after it, knocking down chairs and vases in
their efforts to catch the mouse and put it back in the tureen. In the
middle of all the noise the door opened. The mouse ran out between
the feet of the king. In one instant both the man and his wife were
hiding under the table. To all appearance the room was empty.

'You may as well come out,' said the king, 'and hear what I have to
say.'

'I know what it is,' answered the charcoal-burner, hanging his head. 'The
mouse has escaped.'

'A guard of soldiers will take you back to your hut,' said the king.
'Your wife has the key.'

Not long after this, through the malice of some of his friends, he fell into disgrace at Court and was dismissed. This misfortune so preyed upon his mind that he did not long survive his dismissal. He died, leaving behind him his beautiful young wife to face the world alone. Fearing her husband's enemies, she fled to the Ashigara Mountains as soon as her husband was dead. There in the lonely forests where no one ever came except woodcutters, a little boy was born to her. She called him Kintaro or the Golden Boy. Now the remarkable thing about this child was his great strength, and as he grew older he grew stronger and stronger. By the time he was eight years of age he was able to cut down trees as quickly as the woodcutters. Then his mother gave him a large ax, and he used to go out in the forest and help the woodcutters, who called him ""Wonder-child,"" and his mother the ""Old Nurse of the Mountains,"" for they did not know her high rank.

As he had no companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak their strange talk.

""That will be great fun,"" said she. ""I am the strongest animal, so I will make the platform for the wrestlers."" She set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape.

""All right,"" said Kintaro, ""I will look on while you all wrestle with each other. I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round.""

""He, he!"" answered the deer. ""I will be umpire. Now, Mr. Monkey and Mr. Hare, if you are both ready, please walk out and take your places on the platform.""

Then the monkey and the hare both hopped out, quickly and nimbly, to the wrestling platform. The deer, as umpire, stood between the two and called out:

""Red-back! Red-back!"" (this to the monkey, who has a red back in Japan). ""Are you ready?""

Then he turned to the hare:

""Long-ears! Long-ears! are you ready?""

""Long-ears! Long-ears! be strong, be strong-don't let the monkey beat you!"" grunted the bear.

""I have not been fairly beaten. My foot slipped and I tumbled. Please give me another chance and let the hare wrestle with me for another round.""

Then Kintaro consenting, the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again. Now, as every one knows, the monkey is a cunning animal by nature, and he made up his mind to get the best of the hare this time if it were possible. To do this, he thought that the best and surest way would be to get hold of the hare's long ear. This he soon managed to do. The hare was quite thrown off his guard by the pain of having his long ear pulled so hard. The monkey seizing his opportunity at last, caught hold of one of the hare's legs and sent him sprawling in the middle of the dais.

At last Kintaro got up and said:

""This is enough for to-day. What a nice place we have found for wrestling! Let us come again to-morrow. Now, we will all go home. Come along!"" So saying, Kintaro led the way while the animals followed.

After walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a valley. Kintaro and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing.

The bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now.

Kintaro went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank. At last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the water's edge. He took hold of the trunk and pulled it with all his might, once, twice, thrice!

While all this was going on by the river a woodcutter, who happened to be standing on a rock overlooking the stream, had seen all that passed beneath him.

He hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them. Kintaro knew nothing of all this, and little guessed that he was being followed.

shape; while his younger brother, Kwasynd, manly in appearance, active,
and strong, partook of the nature of the present race of beings.

They lived off the path, in a wild, lonesome place, far retired from

winter evenings he passed the time in telling his brother stories of the
giants, spirits, weendigoes, and fairies of the elder age, when they had
the exclusive charge of the world. He also at times taught his brother
the manner in which game should be pursued, pointed out to him the ways

duties as the provider of the lodge; but at length he grew weary of
their tranquil life, and began to have a desire to show himself among
men. He became restive in their retirement, and was seized with a
longing to visit remote places.

One day, Kwasynd told his brother that he should leave him; that he
wished to visit the habitations of men, and to procure a wife.

poles where they had passed. It was winter; and coming to a place where
one of their company had died, he found upon a scaffold, lying at length
in the cold blue air, the body of a beautiful young woman. ""She shall be
my wife!"" exclaimed Kwasynd.

He lifted her up, and bearing her in his arms, he returned to his
brother. ""Brother,"" he said, ""can not you restore her to life? Oh, do me
that favor!""

Kwasynd from the hunt. And by following his directions, which were those
of one deeply skilled in the chase, Kwasynd always succeeded in
returning with a good store of meat.

But the charge of the two brothers was greatly lightened by the presence
of the spirit-wife; for without labor of the hand, she ordered the
lodge, and as she willed, every thing took its place, and was at once in
proper array. The wish of her heart seemed to control whatever she
looked upon, and it obeyed her desire.",38,readiness,is a,state,What is readiness?,Readiness ia the state of being ready.

never partook of food, nor shared in any way the longings and appetites
of a mortal creature. She had never been seen arranging her hair, like
other females, or at work upon her garments, and yet they were ever
seemly, and without blemish or disorder.

Behold her at any hour, she was ever beautiful, and she seemed to need
no ornament, nor nourishment, nor other aid, to give grace or strength
to her looks.

Kwasynd, when the first wonder of her ways had passed, payed little heed

abroad, pursuing the wild game, or in the lodge, enjoying its savory
spoil, than the society of his spirit-wife.",136,wild,is a,natural_region,What is the wild?,The wild is a natural region.

often forgot, like her, all mortal appetite and care of the body, in
conferring with her, and noting what she had to say of spirits and
fairies, of stars, and streams that never ceased to flow, and the
delight of the happy hunting-grounds, and the groves of the blessed.

One day Kwasynd had gone out as usual, and Bokwewa was sitting in the
lodge, on the opposite side to his brother's wife, when she suddenly
exclaimed:

""I must leave you,"" as a tall young man, whose face was like the sun in
its brightness, entered, and taking her by the hand he led her to the
door.",52,cease,is a,end,What does it mean to cease?,To cease means to put an end to something.
bokwewa-the-humpback,9,"She made no resistance, but turning as she left the lodge, she cast upon
Bokwewa a smile of kind regard, and was at once, with her companion,
gone from his view.

He ran to the door and glanced about. He saw nothing; but looking far
off in the sky, he thought that he could discover, at a great distance,
a shining track, and the dim figures of two who were vanishing in
heaven.

When his brother returned, Bokwewa related all to him exactly as it had
happened.

The face of Kwasynd changed, and was dark as the night. For several days
he would not taste food. Sometimes he would fall to weeping for a long
time, and now only it seemed that he remembered how gentle and beautiful
had been the ways of her who was lost. At last he said that he would go
in search of her.",144,gentle,is the antonym of,rude,What is the opposite of gentle?,Rude.
bokwewa-the-humpback,10,"Bokwewa tried to dissuade him from it; but he would not be turned aside
from his purpose.

""Since you are resolved,"" said Bokwewa, ""listen to my advice. You will
have to go South. It is a long distance to the present abiding-place of
your wife, and there are so many charms and temptations by the way that
I fear you will be led astray and forget your errand. For the people
whom you will see in the country through which you have to pass, do
nothing but amuse themselves. They are very idle, gay and effeminate,
and I fear that they will lead you astray. Your path is beset with
dangers. I will mention one or two things which you must be on your
guard against.",130,mention,has subevent,notice,What does ir mean to mention?,To mention means to make something noticed by a target.

poisonous. Step over it. It is a snake. You will next come to something
that looks like bear's fat, of which you are so fond. Touch it not, or
you will be overcome by the soft habits of the idle people. It is frog's
eggs. These are snares laid by the way for you.""

Kwasynd promised that he would observe the advice and bidding his
brother farewell, he set out. After traveling a long time he came to the
enchanted grape-vine. It looked so tempting, with its swelling purple
clusters, that he forgot his brother's warning, and tasted the fruit. He
went on till he came to the frog's eggs. They so much resembled
delicious bear's fat that Kwasynd tasted them. He still went on.",86,snare,is a,trap,What is a snare?,A snare is a trap.
bokwewa-the-humpback,12,"At length he came to a wide plain. As he emerged from the forest the sun
was falling in the west, and it cast its scarlet and golden shades far
over the country. The air was perfectly calm, and the whole prospect had
the air of an enchanted land. Fruits and flowers, and delicate
blossoms, lured the eye and delighted the senses.

At a distance he beheld a large village, swarming with people, and as he
drew near he discovered women beating corn in silver mortars.

When they saw Kwasynd approaching, they cried out:

""Bokwewa's brother has come to see us.""

Throngs of men and women, in bright apparel, hurried out to meet him.",126,apparel,is a,clothing,What is apparel?,Apparel is another word for clothing.

by their fair looks and soft speeches, and he was not long afterward
seen beating corn with the women, having entirely abandoned all further
quest for his lost wife.

Meantime, Bokwewa, alone in the lodge, often musing upon the discourse
of the spirit-wife, who was gone, waited patiently his brother's return.
After the lapse of several years, when no tidings could be had, he set
out in search of him, and he arrived in safety among the soft and idle
people of the South. He met the same allurements by the way, and they
gathered around him on his coming as they had around his brother
Kwasynd; but Bokwewa was proof against their flattery. He only grieved
in his heart that any should yield.",143,flattery,is used for,butter_up,What is flattery?,Flattery is unsincere words used to butter someone up.

a hunter, and that he was beating corn with the women, indifferent to
the fate and the fortune of his lost wife.

Bokwewa ascertained that his brother's wife had passed on to a country
beyond.

After deliberating for a time, and spending several days in a severe
fast, he set out in the direction where he saw that a light shone from
the sky.

It was far off, but Bokwewa had a stout heart; and strong in the faith
that he was now on the broad path toward the happy land, he pressed
forward. For many days he traveled without encountering any thing
unusual.",38,lose,has subevent,look_for,What should we do if we lose something?,We should look for it.
bokwewa-the-humpback,15,"And now plains of vast extent, and rich in waving grass, began
to pass before his eyes. He saw many beautiful groves, and heard the
songs of countless birds.

At length he began to fail in strength for lack of food; when he
suddenly reached a high ground. From this he caught the first glimpse of
the other land. But it appeared to be still far off, and all the country
between, partly vailed in silvery mists, glittered with lakes and
streams of water. As he pressed on, Bokwewa came in sight of innumerable
herds of stately deer, moose, and other animals which walked near his
path, and they appeared to have no fear of man.",24,grove,is a,forest,What is a grove?,A grove is a small forest.

more, he beheld, coming toward him, an immense number of men, women,
and children, pressing forward in the direction of the shining land.

In this vast throng Bokwewa beheld persons of every age, from the little
infant, the sweet and lovely penaisee, or younger son, to the feeble,
gray old man, stooping under the burden of his years.

All whom Bokwewa met, of every name and degree, were heavily laden with
pipes, weapons, bows, arrows, kettles and other wares and implements.

Another offered him a kettle; another his bow and arrows; but he
declined all, and, free of foot, hastened on.",116,implement,is a,device,What is an implement?,An implement is a device or a tool.

arrows, the gift of their friends.

With this mighty throng, Bokwewa was borne along for two days and
nights, when he arrived at a country so still and shining, and so
beautiful in its woods and groves and plains, that he knew it was here
that he should find the lost spirit-wife.

He had scarcely entered this fair country, with a sense of home and the
return to things familiar strong upon him, when there appeared before
him the lost spirit-wife herself, who, taking him by the hand, gave him
welcome, saying, ""My brother, I am glad to see you. Welcome! welcome!

brave-tin-soldier,1,"There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, ""Tin soldiers!"" uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off. They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable.",38,uniform,is a,special_outfit,What is a uniform?,A uniform is a special outfit worn to indicate factions.

Through the small windows the rooms could be seen. In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake. Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake, and were reflected in it. All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she, also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf. In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face.",124,muslin,is a,fabric,What is muslin?,Muslin is a type of thin cotton fabric.

Still I must try and make her acquaintance.""

Then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls. The tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table. There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places. She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. He never took his eyes from her for even a moment. The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; but, instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin; for the snuff-box was a toy puzzle.",186,goblin,is a,greenskin,What is a goblin?,A goblin is a mythical being that has greenskin.

Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the street beneath. It was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. The servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him. If he had called out, ""Here I am,"" it would have been all right, but he was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform.",96,heel,is a,body_part,What is a heel?,A heel is the body part that connects the foot to the leg.

When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, ""Look, there is a tin soldier. He ought to have a boat to sail in."" So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands. Good gracious, what large waves arose in that gutter! and how fast the stream rolled on! for the rain had been very heavy. The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.

""Have you a passport?"" asked the rat, ""give it to me at once."" But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever. The boat sailed on and the rat followed it. How he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, ""Stop him, stop him; he has not paid toll, and has not shown his pass."" But the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended.

brave-tin-soldier,8,"At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us. He was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldier could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was not afraid. The boat whirled round three or four times, and then filled with water to the very edge; nothing could save it from sinking. He now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier's head.

The fish had been caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. She picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room. They were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had travelled about inside a fish; but he was not at all proud. They placed him on the table, and--how many curious things do happen in the world!--there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself.",98,waist,is a,body_part,What is a waist?,A waist is the body part that connects the pelvis to the stomach.

Presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier, and threw him into the stove. He had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box. The flames lighted up the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible, but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell. Then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say.

If our mother only knew, how she would pity us! Come, let us go together out into the wide world!"" 
So they went, and journeyed the whole day through fields and meadows and stony places, and if it rained the sister said,

So the brother got down and led his sister by the hand, and they went to seek the brook. But their wicked stepmother was a witch, and had known quite well that the two children had run away, and had sneaked after them, as only witches can, and had laid a spell on all the brooks in the forest. So when they found a little stream flowing smoothly over its pebbles, the brother was going to drink of it; but the sister heard how it said in its rushing, 
    ""He a tiger will be who drinks of me,     Who drinks of me a tiger will be!""

Then the sister cried, 
""Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will be turned into a wolf, and will eat me up!"" 
So the brother refrained from drinking, and said, 
""I will wait until we come to the next brook, and then I must drink, whatever you say; my thirst is so great."" 
And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how in its rushing it said, 
    ""Who drinks of me a fawn will be,     He a fawn will be who drinks of me!"" 
Then the sister said, 
""O my brother, I pray drink not, or you will be turned into a fawn, and run away far from me.""

Then she untied her golden girdle and bound it round the fawn's neck, and went and gathered rushes to make a soft cord, which she fastened to him; and then she led him on, and they went deeper into the forest.

At night, when the sister was tired, and had said her prayers, she laid her head on the fawn's back, which served her for a pillow, and softly fell asleep. And if only the brother could have got back his own shape again, it would have been a charming life. So they lived a long while in the wilderness alone. 
Now it happened that the King of that country held a great hunt in the forest. The blowing of the horns, the barking of the dogs, and the lusty shouts of the huntsmen sounded through the wood, and the fawn heard them and was eager to be among them.

Then the fawn sprang out, and felt glad and merry in the open air. The King and his huntsmen saw the beautiful animal, and began at once to pursue him, but they could not come within reach of him, for when they thought they were certain of him he sprang away over the bushes and disappeared.

""Little sister, let me out, I must go."" The sister opened the door and said, 
""Now, mind you must come back at night and say the same words."" 
When the King and his hunters saw the fawn with the golden collar again, they chased him closely, but he was too nimble and swift for them. This lasted the whole day, and at last the hunters surrounded him, and one of them wounded his foot a little, so that he was obliged to limp and to go slowly. Then a hunter slipped after him to the little house, and heard how he called out, ""Little sister, let me in,"" and saw the door open and shut again after him directly. The hunter noticed all this carefully, went to the King, and told him all he had seen and heard. Then said the King, 
""To-morrow we will hunt again.""",100,fawn,is a,deer,What is a fawn?,A fawn is a baby deer.

The wound was very slight, so that the fawn felt nothing of it the next morning. And when he heard the noise of the hunting outside, he said, 
""I cannot stay in, I must go after them; I shall not be taken easily again!"" The sister began to weep, and said, 
""I know you will be killed, and I left alone here in the forest, and forsaken of everybody. I cannot let you go!"" 
""Then I shall die here with longing,"" answered the fawn; ""when I hear the sound of the horn I feel as if I should leap out of my skin."" 
Then the sister, seeing there was no help for it, unlocked the door with a heavy heart, and the fawn bounded away into the forest, well and merry. When the King saw him, he said to his hunters,

Then the door opened, and the King went in, and there stood a maiden more beautiful than any he had seen before. The maiden shrieked out when she saw, instead of the fawn, a man standing there with a gold crown on his head. But the King looked kindly on her, took her by the hand, and said, 
""Will you go with me to my castle, and be my dear wife?"" 
""Oh yes,"" answered the maiden, ""but the fawn must come too. I could not leave him."" And the King said,

Now the wicked stepmother, whose fault it was that the children were driven out into the world, never dreamed but that the sister had been eaten up by wild beasts in the forest, and that the brother, in the likeness of a fawn, had been slain by the hunters.

In the evening, when the King came home and heard that a little son was born to him, he rejoiced with all his heart, and was going at once to his dear wife's bedside to see how she did.

She did not forget the fawn either: she went to him where he lay in the corner, and stroked his back tenderly. Then she went in perfect silence out at the door, and the nurse next morning asked the watchmen if any one had entered the castle during the night, but they said they had seen no one.

canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,1,"It chanced, long years ago, that a certain horse-dealer lived in the
South of Scotland, near the Border. It was not very far from Longtown. He was
known as Canonbie Dick. As he went up and down the country, he
almost always had a long string of horses behind him. He bought them at
one fair and sold at another, generally managing to turn a good big
penny by the transaction.

He was a very fearless man, not easily daunted. The people who knew
him used to say that if Canonbie Dick dare not attempt a thing, no one
else need be asked to do it.

One evening, he was returning from a fair at some distance from his
home with a pair of horses which he had not succeeded in selling. He was
riding over Bowden Moor, which lies to the west of the Eildon Hills.
These hills are, as all men know, the scene of some of the most famous
of Thomas the Rhymer's prophecies. Also, so men say, they are the
sleeping-place of King Arthur and his Knights, who rest under the three
high peaks, waiting for the mystic call that shall awake them.",204,knight,is capable of,ride_horse,What can knights do?,They can ride horses.

Thomas the Rhymer. He was riding along at a snail's pace, thinking over
the bargains which he had made at the fair that day. He was wondering when
he was likely to dispose of his two remaining horses.

All at once he was startled by the approach of a venerable man, with
white hair and an old-world dress, who seemed almost to start out of the
ground, so suddenly did he make his appearance.

When they met, the stranger stopped. To Canonbie Dick's great
amazement, asked him for how much he would be willing to part with his
horses.",55,horse,is used for,riding,What are horses used for?,Riding.
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,3,"The wily horse-dealer thought that he saw a chance of driving a good
bargain. The stranger looked a man of some consequence; so he named
a good round sum.

The old man tried to bargain with him; but when he found that he had not
much chance of succeeding. No one ever did succeed in inducing
Canonbie Dick to sell a horse for a less sum than he named for it at
first. He agreed to buy the animals, and, pulling a bag of gold from the
pocket of his queerly cut breeches. He began to count out the price.

As he did so, Canonbie Dick got another shock of surprise. The
gold that the stranger gave him was not the gold that was in use at the
time, but was fashioned into Unicorns, and Bonnet-pieces, and other
ancient coins. It would be of no use to the horse-dealer in his
everyday transactions. But it was good, pure gold. He took it
gladly. He knew that he was selling his horses at about half as much
again as they were worth. ""So,"" thought he to himself, ""surely I cannot
be the loser in the long run.""",84,animal,is at location of,zoo,Where can we see animals ?,In the zoo.
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,4,"Then the two parted, but not before the old man had commissioned Dick to
get him other good horses at the same price. The only stipulation he
made being that Dick should always bring them to the same spot, after
dark, and that he should always come alone.

And, as time went on, the horse-dealer found that he had indeed met a
good customer.

For, whenever he came across a suitable horse, he had only to lead it
over Bowden Moor after dark. He was sure to meet the mysterious,
white-headed stranger, who always paid him for the animal in
old-fashioned golden pieces.

knowing this, took care always to provide him with something to drink.
The old man never did so. He paid down his money and led away his
horses. There was an end of the matter.

But one night, Dick, being even more thirsty than usual. He was feeling
sure that his mysterious friend must live somewhere in the
neighbourhood. He saw that he was always wandering about the hillside
when everyone else was asleep. He hinted that he would be very glad to go
home with him and have a little refreshment.",7,thirsty,causes,drink_water,What do we do when feeling thirsty ?,We drink water.

this--if thy courage fail thee at that which thou wilt behold, thou wilt
rue it all thy life.""

Canonbie Dick laughed long and loud. ""My courage have never failed me
yet,"" he cried. ""Beshrew me if I will let it fail now. So lead on, old
man, and I will follow.""

Without a word the stranger turned and began to ascend a narrow path
which led to a curious hillock. From its shape, was called by the
country-folk the ""Lucken Hare.""",113,ascend,is the antonym of,descend,What is opposite to ascending?,Descending.

Canonbie Dick was not afraid of Witches. He followed his
guide with a bold step up the hillside. It must be confessed that he
felt a little startled when he saw him turn down what seemed to be an
entrance to a cavern. He never remembered having seen any
opening in the hillside there before.

He paused for a moment, looking round him in perplexity, wondering where
he was being taken. His conductor glanced at him scornfully.",77,remember,has subevent,write_down,What can help us remember something?,Writing down.

where this passage stands on the hillside, so as to know it another

thou wouldst visit it again,"" he said. And then he pursued his way, with
Dick following closely at his heels.",120,heel,is part of,shoes,Where can we see heels?,On shoes.
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,9,"After the first yard or two they were enveloped in thick darkness. The horse-dealer would have been sore put to it to keep near his guide
had not the latter held out his hand for him to grasp. But after a
little space a faint glimmering of light began to appear, which grew
clearer and clearer. At last they found themselves in an enormous
cavern lit by flaming torches, which were stuck here and there in
sconces in the rocky walls. Although they served to give
light enough to see by, yet threw such ghostly shadows on the floor that
they only seemed to intensify the gloom that hung over the vast
apartment.

And the curious thing about this mysterious cave was that, along one
side of it, ran a long row of horse stalls, just like what one would
find in a stable. In each stall stood a coal-black charger, saddled
and bridled, as if ready for the fray. On the straw, by every
horse's side, lay the gallant figure of a knight, clad from head to foot
in coal-black armour, with a drawn sword in his mailed hand.

But not a horse moved, not a chain rattled. Knights and steeds alike
were silent and motionless, looking exactly as if some strange
enchantment had been thrown over them. They had been suddenly turned
into black marble.",3,yard,is used for,playing,What can we do in the yard?,We can play in the yard.
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,10,"There was something so awesome in the still, cold figures. In the
unearthly silence that brooded over everything that Canonbie Dick,
reckless and daring though he was, felt his courage waning and his knees
beginning to shake under him.

In spite of these feelings, however, he followed the old man up the hall
to the far end of it. There was a table of ancient workmanship, on
which was placed a glittering sword and a curiously wrought
hunting-horn.",9,cold,causes,light_fire,What can we do to relieve the feeling of coldness?,We can light fire.
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,11,"When they reached this table the stranger turned to him. He said, with
great dignity, ""Thou hast heard, good man, of Thomas of
Ercildoune--Thomas the Rhymer, as men call him. He who went to dwell for
a time with the Queen of Fairy-land, and from her received the Gifts of
Truth and Prophecy?""

Canonbie Dick nodded; for as the wonderful Soothsayer's name fell on his
ears, his heart sank within him and his tongue seemed to cleave to the
roof of his mouth. If he had been brought there to parley with Thomas
the Rhymer, then had he laid himself open to all the eldrich Powers of
Darkness.

""I that speak to you am he,"" went on the white-haired stranger. ""And I
have permitted thee thus to have thy desire and follow me hither in
order that I may try of what stuff thou art made. Before thee lies a
Horn and a Sword. He that will sound the one, or draw the other, shall,
if his courage fail not, be King over the whole of Britain. I, Thomas
the Rhymer, have spoken it. As thou knowest, my tongue cannot lie.
But list ye, the outcome of it all depends on thy bravery. It will
be a light task, or a heavy, according as thou layest hand on Sword or
Horn first.""",251,heavy,is the antonym of,light,What is opposite to heavy?,Light.
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,12,"Now Dick was more versed in giving blows than in making music. His
first impulse was to seize the Sword, then, come what might, he had
something in his hand to defend himself with. But just as he was about
to lift it the thought struck him that, if the place were full of
spirits, as he felt sure that it must be, this action of him might be
taken to mean defiance. This might cause them to band themselves together
against him.

So, changing his mind, he picked up the Horn with a trembling hand. He
blew a blast upon it, which, however, was so weak and feeble that it
could scarce be heard at the other end of the hall.

The result that followed was enough to appal the stoutest heart. Thunder
rolled in crashing peals through the immense hall. The charmed Knights
and their horses woke in an instant from their enchanted sleep. The
Knights sprang to their feet and seized their swords, brandishing them
round their heads. Their great black chargers stamped, and
snorted, and ground their bits, as if eager to escape from their stalls.
And where a moment before all had been stillness and silence, there was
now a scene of wild din and excitement.",122,weak,is the antonym of,strong,What is opposite to weak?,Strong.
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,13,"Now was the time for Canonbie Dick to play the man. If he had done so
all the rest of his life might have been different.

But his courage failed him, and he lost his chance. Terrified at seeing
so many threatening faces turned towards him, he dropped the Horn. He made one weak, undecided effort to pick up the Sword.

But, ere he could do so, a mysterious voice sounded from somewhere in
the hall. These were the words that it uttered:

    ""Woe to the coward, that ever he was born,
    Who did not draw the Sword before he blew the Horn.""

And, before Dick knew what he was about, a perfect whirlwind of cold,
raw air tore through the cavern, carrying the luckless horse-dealer
along with it. Hurrying him along the narrow passage through which
he had entered, dashed him down outside on a bank of loose stones and
shale. He fell right to the bottom. He was found, with little life left
in him, next morning, by some shepherds, He had just strength
enough left to whisper the story of his weird and fearful adventure.",195,morning,is the antonym of,night,What is opposite to morning?,Night.

comrade,3,"""Do you think there is any one who would pay all that money for such an
arrant sinner's sake?"" inquired the pastor.

""Yes,"" said the youth. If he could manage to have him buried, he would
be willing to pay for the wake out of his own slender purse.

At first the pastor would hear nothing of it. But when the youth
returned with two men, and asked him in their presence whether he
refused the dead man Christian burial, he ventured no further
objections.",3,think,causes,cogitate,What does thinking cause?,Cogitate.
comrade,4,"So they released the wine-dealer from his block of ice, and laid him in
consecrated ground. The bells tolled, and there was singing, and the
pastor threw earth on the coffin, and they had a wake at which tears and
laughter alternated. But when the youth had paid for the wake, he had
but a few shillings left in his pocket. Then he once more set out on
his way. He had not gone far before a man came up behind him, and
asked him whether he did not find it tiresome to wander along all alone.",25,sing,has context of,music,What can we sing?,We sing songs.
comrade,5,"""No,"" said the youth, he always had something to think about. The man
asked whether he did not need a servant.

""No,"" said the youth, ""I am used to serving myself, so I have no need of
a servant. No matter how much I might wish for one, I still would
have to do without, since I have no money for his keep and pay.""

""Yet you need a servant, as I know better than you do,"" said the man,
""and you need one upon whom you can rely in life and death. But if you
do not want me for a servant, then let me be your comrade. I promise
that you will not lose thereby, and I will not cost you a shilling. I
travel at my own expense, nor need you be put to trouble as regards my
food and clothing.""",18,ask,has subevent,communicate,Why do we ask?,To communicate.
comrade,6,"Under these circumstances the youth was glad to have him for a comrade,
and they resumed their journey, the man as a rule going in advance and
pointing out the way.

After they had wandered long through various lands, over hills and over
heaths, they suddenly stood before a wall of rock. The comrade knocked,
and begged to be let in. Then the rock opened before them, and after
they had gone quite a way into the interior of the hill, a witch came to
meet them and offered them a chair. ""Be so good as to sit down, for you
must be weary!"" said she.",2,circumstance,is a,information,What can we know from circumstances?,Information.
comrade,7,"""Sit down yourself!"" answered the man. Then she had to sit down and
remain seated, for the chair had power to hold fast all that approached
it. In the meantime they wandered about in the hill, and the comrade
kept looking around until he saw a sword that hung above the door. This
he wanted to have, and he promised the witch that he would release her
from her chair if she would let him have the sword.

""No,"" she cried, ""ask what you will. You can have anything else, but not
that, for that is my Three-Sisters Sword!"" (There were three sisters to
whom the sword belonged in common.) ""Then you may sit where you are till
the world's end!"" said the man. And when she heard that she promised to
let him have the sword, if he would release her.",41,hill,is at location of,countryside,Where can we see hills?,Near the countryside.
comrade,8,"So he took the sword, and went away with it; but he left her sitting
there, after all. When they had wandered far, over stony wastes and
desolate heaths, they again came to a wall of rock. There the comrade
again knocked, and begged to be let in. Just as before, the rock opened,
and when they had gone far into the hill, a witch came to meet them with
a chair and bade them be seated, ""for you must be tired,"" said she.",14,left,is a,position,What do we describe by the word left?,Left is a position.
comrade,9,"""Sit down yourself!"" said the comrade. And what had happened to her
sister happened to her, she had to seat herself, and could not get up
again. In the meantime the youth and his comrade went about in the hill,
and the latter opened all the closets and drawers, until he found what
he had been searching for, a ball of golden twine. This he wished to
have, and promised he would release her from the chair if she would give
it to him. She told him he might have all she possessed; but that she
could not give him the ball, since it was her Three-Sisters Ball. But
when she heard that she would have to sit in the chair till the Day of
Judgment, she changed her mind. Then the comrade took the ball, and in
spite of it left her sitting where she was. Then they wandered for many
a day through wood and heath, until they came to a wall of rock. All
happened as it had twice before, the comrade knocked, the hill opened,
and inside a witch came to meet them with a chair, and bade them sit
down. The two had gone through many rooms before the comrade spied an
old hat hanging on a hook behind the door. The hat he must have, but the
old witch would not part with it, since it was her Three-Sisters Hat,
and if she gave it away she would be thoroughly unhappy. But when she
heard that she would have to sit there until the Day of Judgment if she
did not give up the hat, she at last agreed to do so. The comrade took
the hat, and then told her to keep on sitting where she sat, like her
sisters.",51,open,is the antonym of,closed,What is opposite to open?,Closed.
comrade,10,"At length they came to a river. There the comrade took the ball of
golden twine and flung it against the hill on the other side of the
river with such force that it bounded back. And when it had flown back
and forth several times, there stood a bridge, and when they had reached
the other side, the comrade told the youth to wind up the golden twine
again as swiftly as possible, ""for if we do not take it away quickly,
the three witches will cross and tear us to pieces."" The youth wound as
quickly as he could. Just as he was at the last thread, the witches
rushed up, hissing, flung themselves into the water so that the foam
splashed high, and snatched at the end of the thread. But they could not
grasp it, and drowned in the river.",119,thread,is used for,sewing,What is thread used for?,Sewing.
comrade,11,"After they had again wandered on for a few days, the comrade said: ""Now
we will soon reach the castle in which she lives, the princess of whom
you dreamed, and when we reach it, you must go to the castle and tell
the king what you dreamed, and your journey's aim."" When they got there,
the youth did as he was told, and was very well received. He was given a
room for himself, and one for his servant, and when it was time to eat,
he was invited to the king's own table. When he saw the princess, he
recognized her at once as the vision of his dream. He told her, too, why
he was there, and she replied that she liked him quite well, and would
gladly take him, but first he must undergo three tests. When they had
eaten, she gave him a pair of gold shears and said: ""The first test
is that you take these shears and keep them, and give them back to me
to-morrow noon. That is not a very severe test,"" she said, and smiled,
""but, if you cannot stand it, you must die, as the law demands, and you
will be in the same case as the suitors whose bones you may see lying
without the castle gate.""",180,say,has subevent,convey,What do we want to do when we say something?,We want to convey messages.
comrade,12,"""That is no great feat,"" thought the youth to himself. But the princess
was so merry and active, and so full of fun and nonsense, that he
thought neither of the shears nor of himself. While they were
laughing and joking, she secretly robbed him of the shears without his
noticing it. When he came to his room in the evening, and told what had
occurred, and what the princess had said to him, and about the shears
which she had given him to guard, his comrade asked: ""And have you still
the shears?""

The youth looked through all his pockets; but his shears were not there,
and he was more than unhappy when he realized that he had lost them.",100,ask,has subevent,request,What is it when we ask for something?,A request.
comrade,13,"""Well, well, never mind. I will see whether I can get them back for
you,"" said his comrade, and went down into the stable. There stood an
enormous goat which belonged to the princess, and could fly through the
air more swiftly than he could walk on level ground. The comrade took
the Three-Sisters Sword, gave him a blow between the horns, and asked:
""At what time does the princess ride to meet her lover to-night?"" The
goat bleated, and said he did not dare tell. When the comrade had
given him another thump, he did say that the princess would come at
eleven o'clock sharp. Then the comrade put on the Three-Sisters Hat,
which made him invisible, and waited for the princess. When she came,
she anointed the goat with a salve she carried in a great horn, and
cried out: ""Up, up! over gable and roof, over land and sea, over hill
and dale, to my dearest, who waits for me in the hill!""",6,mind,is used for,thinking,What is kind used for?,For thinking.
comrade,14,"As the goat flew upward, the comrade swung himself up in back, and
then they were off like the wind through the clouds: it was not a long
journey. Suddenly they stood before a wall of rock, she knocked, and
then they took their way into the interior of the hill, to the troll who
was her dearest. ""And now a new suitor has come who wants to win me,
sweetheart,"" said she. ""He is young and handsome, but I will have none
but you,"" she went on, and made a great time over the troll. ""I have set
him a test, and here are the shears that he was to keep and guard. You
shall keep them now!"" Then both of them laughed as though the youth had
already lost his head. ""Yes, I will keep them, and take good care of
them, and a kiss from you shall pledge the truth, when crows are cawing
around the youth!"" said the troll. He laid the shears in an iron
chest with three locks. But at the moment he was dropping the shears
into the chest, the comrade caught them up. None could see him, for he
was wearing the Three-Sisters Hat. So the troll carefully locked the
empty chest, and put the key into a hollow double-tooth, where he kept
other magic things. ""The suitor could hardly find it there,"" said he.",4,upward,is the antonym of,down,What is opposite to upward?,Downward.
comrade,15,"After midnight the princess set out for home. The comrade swung himself
up in back again, and the trip home did not take long.

The following noon the youth was invited to dine at the king's table.
But this time the princess kept her nose in the air, and was so haughty
and snappish that she hardly condescended to glance in the youth's
direction. But after they had eaten, she looked very solemn, and asked
in the sweetest manner: ""You probably still have the shears I gave you
to take care of yesterday?""",40,table,is used for,putting_things_on,What are tables used for?,Putting things on.
comrade,16,"""Yes, here they are,"" said the youth; and he flung them on the table so
that they rang. The princess could not have been more frightened had he
thrown the shears in her face. But she tried to make the best of a bad
bargain, and said in a sweet voice: ""Since you have taken such good care
of the shears, you will not find it hard to keep my ball of gold twine
for me. I should like to have it back by to-morrow noon. But if you
cannot give it to me then, you must die, according to the law."" The
youth thought it would not be so very hard, and put the ball of gold
twine in his pocket. Yet the princess once more began to toy and joke
with him, so that he thought neither of himself nor of the ball of gold
twine, and while they were in the midst of their merry play she stole
the golden ball from him, and then dismissed him.

When he came up into his room, and told what she had said and done, his
comrade asked: ""And have you still the ball of gold twine?""",47,best,is the antonym of,worst,What is opposite to best?,Worst.
comrade,17,"""Yes, indeed,"" said the youth, and thrust his hand into the pocket in
which he had placed it. But there was no ball in it, and he fell into
such despair that he did not know what to do.

""Do not worry,"" said his comrade. ""I will see whether I cannot get it
back for you."" He took his sword and his hat, and went to a smith and
had him weld twelve extra pounds of iron to his sword. Then, when he
entered the stable, he gave the goat such a blow between the horns with
it that he staggered, and asked: ""At what time does the princess ride to
her dearest to-night?""

""At twelve o'clock sharp,"" said the goat.",50,worry,is a,anxiety,What do you feel when you have worries?,Anxious.
comrade,18,"The comrade once more put on his Three-Sisters Hat, and waited until the
princess came with the horn of ointment and anointed the goat. Then she
repeated what she had already said: ""Up, up! over gable and tower, over
land and sea, over hill and dale, to my dearest who waits for me in the
hill!"" And when the goat arose, the comrade swung himself up in back,
and off they were like lightning through the air. Soon they had reached
the troll-hill, and when she had knocked thrice they passed through the
interior of the hill till they met the troll who was her dearest.

""What manner of care did you take of the golden shears I gave you
yesterday, my friend?"" asked the princess. ""The suitor had them, and he
gave them back to me.""",70,goat,desires,food,What do goats desire?,Food.
comrade,19,"That was quite impossible, said the troll, for he had locked them up in
a chest with three locks, and had thrust the key into his hollow tooth.
But when they had unlocked the chest and looked, there were no shears
there. Then the princess told him that she had now given him her ball of
golden twine.

""Here it is,"" said she. ""I took it away from him again without his
having noticed it; but what are we to do if he is a master of such
arts?""",3,impossible,is the antonym of,possible,What is opposite to impossible?,Possible.
comrade,20,"The troll could not think of anything to suggest. After they had
reflected a while they hit on the idea of lighting a great fire, and
burning the ball of gold twine, for then the suitor could surely not
regain it. Yet when she threw it into the flames, the comrade leaped
forward and caught it, without being seen, for he was wearing the
Three-Sisters Hat. After the princess had stayed a little while she
returned home, and again the comrade sat up behind, and the trip home
was swiftly and safely made. When the youth was asked to the king's
table, the comrade gave him the ball. The princess was still more sharp
and disdainful in her remarks than before, and after they had eaten she
pinched her lips, and said: ""Would it not be possible for me to get my
ball of gold twine again, which I gave you yesterday?""

""Yes,"" said the youth, ""you can have it; there it is!"" and he flung it
on the table with such a thud that the king leaped up in the air with
fright.",8,suggest,has subevent,imply,What do we do when we suggest something?,We imply something.
comrade,21,"The princess grew as pale as a corpse. She made the best of a bad
bargain, and said that he had done well. Now there was only one more
little test for him to undergo. ""If you can bring me what I am thinking
about by to-morrow noon, then you may have me and keep me.""

The youth felt as though he had been condemned to death. It seemed
altogether impossible for him to know of what the princess was thinking,
and still more impossible to bring her the thing in question. And when
he came to his room his comrade could scarcely quiet him. He said he
would take the matter in hand, as he had done on the other occasions,
and at last the youth grew calmer, and lay down to sleep. In the
meantime the comrade went to the smith, and had him weld an additional
twenty-four pounds of iron on his sword. When this had been done, he
went to the stable, and gave the goat such a smashing blow between the
horns that he flew to the other side of the wall.",74,death,is capable of,bring_sorrow,What do you feel when someone is dead?,I feel sorrow.
comrade,22,"""At what time does the princess ride to her dearest to-night?"" said he.

""At one o'clock sharp,"" bleated the goat.

When the time came, the comrade was standing in the stable, wearing his
Three-Sisters Hat, and after the princess had anointed the goat and
spoken her formula, off they went through the air as before, with the
comrade sitting in back. But this time he was anything but gentle, and
kept giving the princess a cuff here, and a cuff there, until she had
received a terrible drubbing. When she reached the wall of rock, she
knocked three times, the hill opened, and they flew through it to her
dearest.",82,gentle,is the antonym of,harsh,What is opposite to gentle?,Harsh.
comrade,23,"She complained bitterly to him, and said she would never have thought it
possible that the weather could affect one so. It had seemed to her as
though some one were flying along with them, beating her and the goat,
and her whole body must be covered with black and blue spots, so badly
had she been thrashed. And then she told how the suitor had again had
the ball of twine. How he had managed to get it, neither she nor the
troll could guess.

""But do you know the thought that came to me?"" said she. Of course the
troll did not.",14,possible,is the antonym of,impossible,What is opposite to possible?,Impossible.
comrade,24,"""Well,"" said she, ""I have told him he is to bring me the thing I am
thinking of by to-morrow noon, and that thing is your head. Do you
think, dear friend, that he will be able to bring it to me?"" and she
made a great time over the troll.

""I do not think he can,"" said the troll, who felt quite sure of himself,
and laughed and chortled with pleasure in the most malicious way. For he
and the princess were firmly convinced that the youth would be more apt
to lose his own head, and be left to the ravens, than that he would be
able to bring the princess the head of the troll.",25,noon,is the antonym of,midnight,What is opposite to noon?,Midnight.
comrade,25,"Toward morning the princess wanted to fly home again, but she did not
venture to ride alone; the troll must accompany her. He was quite ready
to do so, took his goat from the stable--he had one just like that of
the princess--and anointed him between the horns. When the troll had
mounted, the comrade swung up in back of him, and off they were through
the air in the direction of the king's castle. But on the way the
comrade beat away lustily at the troll and his goat, and gave him thump
after thump, and blow after blow with his sword, until they were flying
lower and lower, and at last nearly fell into the sea across which their
journey led them. When the troll noticed how stormy the weather was, he
accompanied the princess to the castle, and waited outside to make sure
that she really came home safely. But the moment when the door closed on
the princess, the comrade hewed off his head, and went up with it to
the youth's room.",38,stable,is the antonym of,unstable,What is opposite to stable?,Unstable.
comrade,26,"""Here is the thing of which the princess was thinking,"" said he. Then
everything was in apple-pie order, and when the youth was invited to the
king's table and they had eaten, the princess grew as merry as a lark.
""Have you, perhaps, the thing of which I was thinking?"" ""To be sure,""
said the youth, and he drew forth the head from beneath his coat, and
flung it on the table so that the table and all that was on it fell
over. The princess looked as though she had come from the grave. Yet she
could not deny that this was the thing of which she had thought, and
now she had to take the youth, as she had promised. So the wedding was
celebrated, and there was great joy throughout the kingdom.",143,promise,is a,expectation,What do we have for promise?,We have expectations for the promise.
comrade,27,"But the comrade took the youth aside, and said that on their
wedding-night he might close his eyes and pretend to sleep.
If he loved his life, and followed his advice, he would not sleep a
wink until the princess was freed from her troll-skin. He must whip it
off with nine new switches of birch-wood, and strip it off with three
milk-baths beside. First he must scrub it off in a tub of year-old whey,
then he must rub it off in a tub of sour milk, and finally, he must
sponge it off in a tub of sweet milk. He had laid the birch switches
beneath the bed, and had stood the tubs of milk in the corner; all was
prepared. The youth promised to follow his advice, and do as he had
told him. When night came, and he lay in his bed, the princess raised
herself on her elbows, to see if he were really asleep, and she tickled
him under the nose; but he was sleeping quite soundly. Then she pulled
his hair and his beard. But it seemed to her that he slept like a log.
Then she drew a great butcher's knife out from beneath her pillow, and
wanted to cut off his head. But the youth leaped up, struck the knife
from her hand, seized her by the hair, whipped her with the switches,
and did not stop until not one was left. Thereupon he threw her into the
tub of whey, and then he saw what sort of creature she really was, for
her whole body was coal-black. But when he had scrubbed her in the whey,
and rubbed her in the sour milk, and sponged her in the sweet milk, the
troll-skin had altogether disappeared, and she was lovelier than she had
ever been before.",22,sleep,is the antonym of,awake,What is opposite to sleeping?,Awake.
comrade,28,"On the following day the comrade said that now they must get on their
way. The youth was ready to set forth, and the princess, too, for her
dower had long since been made ready. During the night the comrade had
brought all the gold and silver, and all the valuables which the troll
had left in the hill to the castle. When they wanted to start in
the morning, the castle court-yard was so full they could scarcely get
through. The dower supplied by the troll was worth more than the king's
whole country, and they did not know how they were to take it home. But
the comrade found a way out of the difficulty. The troll had also left
six goats who could fly through the air. These he loaded so heavily
with gold and silver that they had to walk on the ground, and were not
strong enough to rise into the air. What the goats could not carry,
had to be left at the castle. Thus they traveled for a long time, but at
last the goats grew so weary and wretched that they could go no further.
The youth and the princess did not know what to do. When the comrade
saw that they could not move from the spot, he took the whole treasure
on his back, topped it with the goats, and carried it all until they
were no more than half a mile from the youth's home. Then the comrade
said: ""Now I must part from you, for I can stay with you no longer."" But
the youth would not hear of parting, and would not let him go at any
price.",26,princess,is a,female_person,What is the gender of a princess?,She is a female.
comrade,29,"So he went along another half mile, but further than that he could not
go. When the youth pressed him, and insisted that he come home with
him, and stay there; or that he at least celebrate their home-coming,
he merely said no, he could not do so. Then the youth asked him what he
wished in the way of payment for his company and aid. ""If I am to wish
for something, then I would like to have half of all that you may gain
in the course of the next five years,"" said his comrade. And this was
promised him.",27,come,is the antonym of,leave,What is opposite to coming?,Leaving.
comrade,30,"Now when the comrade had gone, the youth hid all his treasure, and went
straight home. And there they celebrated a home-coming feast that was
talked about in seven kingdoms. When that was over they spent the
whole winter going back and forth with the goats, and his father's
twelve horses, bringing all the gold and silver home.

After five years the comrade came again and asked for his share. Then
the man divided all his possessions into two equal parts.",25,feast,has subevent,host,What is a feast used to do?,To host guests.

""What could that be?"" asked the man. ""I thought I had divided
everything.""

""You have been blessed with a child,"" said the comrade, ""and that you
must also divide into two equal parts.""

Yes, such was really the case. Then he took up his sword, but when he
raised it and was about to divide the child, his comrade seized the
point of the sword so that he could not strike.",9,divide,is the antonym of,multiply,What is opposite to divide?,Multiply.
comrade,32,"""Are you not happy, since you need not strike?"" said he.

""Yes, indeed, I never was happier,"" said the man.

""That is how happy I was when you delivered me out of the block of
ice,"" said the comrade. ""Keep all you have: I need nothing, for I am a
disembodied spirit."" And he told him he was the wine-dealer who had lain
in the block of ice before the church door, spat upon by all. He had become his comrade, and had aided him, because the youth had sacrificed all he had in order that he might have peace, and a burial in consecrated ground. He had been permitted to accompany him for the space
of a year, and the time had run out when he had first parted with him.
Now he had once more been allowed to visit him; yet on this occasion he
would have to part for all time, for the bells of heaven were calling
him.",123,peace,is created by,non_voilence,What kind of state is peaceful?,There is no violence.

held his court in the palace of Emain Macha. And this is the way he came
to be King. He was but a young lad, and his father was not living. Fergus, son of Rogh, who was at that time King of Ulster, asked his
mother Ness in marriage.

Now Ness, that was at one time the quietest and kindest of the women of
Ireland, had got to be unkind and treacherous because of an unkindness
that had been done to her. She planned to get the kingdom away from
Fergus for her own son. So she said to Fergus, ""Let Conchubar hold the
kingdom for a year, so that his children after him may be called the
children of a king. That is the marriage portion I will ask of you.""

""You may do that,"" the men of Ulster said to him. ""For even though
Conchubar gets the name of being king, it is yourself that will be our
King all the time."" So Fergus agreed to it, and he took Ness as his
wife, and her son Conchubar was made King in his place.",74,marriage,is a,state_of_being_married,What is marriage?,The state of being married.

She gave great presents to the chief men of Ulster to get them on
her side. And though Conchubar was but a young lad at the time, he was
wise in his judgments and brave in battle, and good in shape and in
form. They liked him well. And at the end of the year, when Fergus
asked to have the kingship back again, they consulted together. It
is what they agreed, that Conchubar was to keep it. And they said, ""It
is little Fergus thinks about us, when he was so ready to give up his
rule over us for a year. Let Conchubar keep the kingship,"" they
said, ""and let Fergus keep the wife he has got.""

Now, it happened one day that Conchubar was making a feast at Emain
Macha for the marriage of his sister Dechtire with Sualtim, son of Roig.
And at the feast Dechtire was thirsty, and they gave her a cup of wine,
and as she was drinking it a mayfly flew into the cup, and she drank it
down with the wine. And presently she went into her sunny parlour, and
her fifty maidens along with her, and she fell into a deep sleep. And in
her sleep Lugh of the Long Hand appeared to her, and he said, ""It is I
myself was the mayfly that came to you in the cup, and it is with me you
must come away now, and your fifty maidens along with you."" And he put
on them the appearance of a flock of birds. They went with him
southward till they came to Brugh na Boinne, the dwelling-place of the
Sidhe. And no one at Emain Macha could get tale or tidings of them, or
know where they had gone, or what had happened them.",49,judgment,is a,act,What is judgment?,The act of judging.

and Conchubar and his chief men were sitting at the feast. And suddenly
they saw from the window a great flock of birds, that lit on the ground
and began to eat up everything before them, so that not so much as a
blade of grass was left.

The men of Ulster were vexed when they saw the birds destroying all
before them, and they yoked nine of their chariots to follow after them.
Conchubar was in his own chariot, and there were following with him
Fergus, son of Rogh, and Laegaire Buadach the Battle-Winner, and
Celthair, son of Uithecar, and many others, and Bricriu of the bitter
tongue was along with them.

They followed after the birds across the whole country southward, across
Slieve Fuad, by Ath Lethan, by Ath Garach and Magh Gossa, between Fir
Rois and Fir Ardae. The birds before them always. They were the most
beautiful that had ever been seen. Nine flocks of them there were,
linked together two-and-two with a chain of silver, and at the head of
every flock there were two birds of different colours, linked together
with a chain of gold. and There were three birds that flew by
themselves, and they all went before the chariots to the far end of the
country, until the fall of night, and then there was no more seen of
them.",61,blade,is part of,knife,What is a blade?,The sharp-edged part of a knife.

is best for us to unyoke the chariots now, and to look for some place
where we can spend the night.""

Then Fergus went forward to look for some place, and what he came to was
a very small poor-looking house. A man and a woman were in it, and when
they saw him they said, ""Bring your companions here along with you, and
they will be welcome."" Fergus went back to his companions and told them
what he had seen. But Bricriu said: ""Where is the use of going into a
house like that, with neither room nor provisions nor coverings in it.
It is not worth our while to be going there.""

Then Bricriu went on himself to the place where the house was. But when
he came to it, what he saw was a grand, new, well-lighted house. At
the door there was a young man wearing armour, very tall and handsome
and shining. And he said, ""Come into the house, Bricriu. Why are you
looking about you?"" And there was a young woman beside him, fine and
noble, and with curled hair, and she said, ""Surely there is a welcome
before you from me."" ""Why does she welcome me?"" said Bricriu. ""It is on
account of her that I myself welcome you,"" said the young man. ""And is
there no one missing from you at Emain?"" he said. ""There is, surely,""
said Bricriu. ""We are missing fifty young girls for the length of a
year."" ""Would you know them again if you saw them?"" said the young man.
""If I would not know them,"" said Bricriu, ""it is because a year might
make a change in them, so that I would not be sure.""",131,provision,has subevent,supply,What is provision?,An item of goods or supplies.

again,"" said the man, ""for the fifty young girls are in this house, and
this woman beside me is their mistress, Dechtire. It was they
themselves, changed into birds, that went to Emain Macha to bring you
here."" Then Dechtire gave Bricriu a purple cloak with gold fringes. He went back to find his companions. But while he was going he thought
to himself, ""Conchubar would give great treasure to find these fifty
young girls again, and his sister along with them. I will not tell him I
have found them. I will only say I have found a house with beautiful
women in it, and no more than that.""

When Conchubar saw Bricriu he asked news of him.

""What news do you bring back with you, Bricriu?"" he said. ""I came to a
fine well-lighted house,"" said Bricriu. ""I saw a queen, noble, kind,
with royal looks, with curled hair. I saw a troop of women, beautiful,
well dressed. I saw the man of the house, tall and open-handed and
shining."" ""Let us go there for the night,"" said Conchubar. So they
brought their chariots and their horses and their arms. They were
hardly in the house when every sort of food and of drink, some they knew
and some they did not know, was put before them, so that they never
spent a better night. And when they had eaten and drunk and began to be
satisfied, Conchubar said to the young man, ""Where is the mistress of
the house that she does not come to bid us welcome?"" ""You cannot see her
to-night,"" said he, ""for she is in the pains of childbirth.""",88,treasure,is a,collection,What is the treasure?,A collection of valuable things.
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,6,"So they rested there that night, and in the morning Conchubar was the
first to rise up. He saw no more of the man of the house, and what
he heard was the cry of a child. And he went to the room it came from,
and there he saw Dechtire, and her maidens about her, and a young child
beside her. And she bade Conchubar welcome, and she told him all that
had happened her, and that she had called him there to bring herself and
the child back to Emain Macha. And Conchubar said, ""It is well you have
done by me, Dechtire. You gave shelter to me and to my chariots. You
kept the cold from my horses. You gave food to me and my people, and now
you have given us this good gift. And let our sister, Finchoem, bring up
the child,"" he said. ""No, it is not for her to bring him up, it is for
me,"" said Sencha, son of Ailell, chief judge and chief poet of Ulster.
""For I am skilled. I am good in disputes. I am not forgetful. I speak
before anyone at all in the presence of the King. I watch over what he
says. I give judgment in the quarrels of kings. I am judge of the men of
Ulster. no one has a right to dispute my claim, but only Conchubar.""

""If the child is given to me to bring up,"" said Blai, the distributor,
""he will not suffer from want of care or from forgetfulness. It is my
messages that do the will of Conchubar. I call up the fighting men from
all Ireland. I am well able to provide for them for a week, or even for
ten days. I settle their business and their disputes. I support their
honour. I get satisfaction for their insults.""",268,dispute,is a,disagreement,What is dispute?,An argument or disagreement.
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,7,"""You think too much of yourself,"" said Fergus. ""It is I that will bring
up the child. I am strong. I have knowledge. I am the King's messenger.
no one can stand up against me in honour or riches. I am hardened to war
and battles. I am a good craftsman. I am worthy to bring up the child. I
am the protector of all the unhappy. The strong are afraid of me. I am
the helper of the weak.""

""If you will listen to me at last, now you are quiet,"" said Amergin, ""I
am able to bring up a child like a king. The people praise my honour, my
bravery, my courage, my wisdom. They praise my good luck, my age, my
speaking, my name, my courage, and my race. Though I am a fighter, I am
a poet. I am worthy of the King's favour. I overcome all the men who
fight from their chariots. I owe thanks to no one except Conchubar. I
obey no one but the King.""

Then Sencha said, ""Let Finchoem keep the child until we come to Emain,
and Morann, the judge, will settle the question when we are there.""",176,poet,is capable of,write_poems,Who write poems?,Poets.
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,8,"So the men of Ulster set out for Emain, Finchoem having the child with
her. And when they came there Morann gave his judgment. ""It is for
Conchubar,"" he said, ""to help the child to a good name, for he is next
of kin to him. Let Sencha teach him words and speaking. Let Fergus hold
him on his knees. Let Amergin be his tutor."" And he said, ""This child
will be praised by all, by chariot drivers and fighters, by kings and by
wise men. He shall be loved by many men. He will avenge all your wrongs. He will defend your fords. He will fight all your battles.""

And so it was settled. And the child was left until he should come to
sensible years with his mother Dechtire and with her husband Sualtim.

was known by was Setanta, son of Sualtim.",88,praise,is capable of,provide_comfort,How can you provide comfort to people?,By praising them frequently.

gift he asked of her. But it is chiefly of the Princess Sylvia that you

was at once original and gentle. She had nearly reached the age at
which the gifts were generally bestowed. However, the Fairy had a great
wish to know how the other princesses who had grown up and left her,
were prospering. Before the time came for Sylvia to go herself, she
resolved to send her to some of them. So one day her chariot, drawn by
butterflies, was made ready, and the Fairy said: 'Sylvia, I am going to
send you to the court of Iris. She will receive you with pleasure for

again, and I shall expect you to tell me what you think of her.'

Flower Fairy lived in a lovely palace, with the most delightful
garden you can imagine. It was full of flowers, and trees, and fountains, and
fish-ponds, and everything nice. For the Fairy herself was so kind
and charming that everybody loved her. All the young princes and
princesses who formed her court, were as happy as the day was long,
simply because they were near her. They came to her when they were quite
tiny, and never left her until they were grown up and had to go away
into the great world. When that time came she gave to each whatever
gift he asked of her. But it is chiefly of the Princess Sylvia that you
are going to hear now. The Fairy loved her with all her heart, for she
was at once original and gentle. She had nearly reached the age at
which the gifts were generally bestowed. However, the Fairy had a great
wish to know how the other princesses who had grown up and left her,
were prospering. Before the time came for Sylvia to go herself, she
resolved to send her to some of them. So one day her chariot, drawn by
butterflies, was made ready, and the Fairy said: 'Sylvia, I am going to
send you to the court of Iris. She will receive you with pleasure for
my sake as well as for your own. In two months you may come back to me
again, and I shall expect you to tell me what you think of her.'

Sylvia was very unwilling to go away, but as the Fairy wished it she
said nothing. Only when the two months were over she stepped joyfully
into the butterfly chariot. She could not get back quickly enough to the
Flower-Fairy, who, for her part, was equally delighted to see her again.",81,court,is used for,trials,What do we use for trials?,Court.
fairy-gifts,2,"'Now, child,' said she, 'tell me what impression you have received.'

'You sent me, madam,' answered Sylvia, 'to the Court of Iris, on whom
you had bestowed the gift of beauty. She never tells anyone, however,
that it was your gift, though she often speaks of your kindness in
general. It seemed to me that her loveliness, which fairly dazzled me at
first, had absolutely deprived her of the use of any of her other gifts
or graces. In allowing herself to be seen, she appeared to think
that she was doing all that could possibly be required of her. But,
unfortunately, while I was still with her she became seriously ill. 
Though she presently recovered, her beauty is entirely gone, so that she
hates the very sight of herself, and is in despair. She entreated me to
tell you what had happened, and to beg you, in pity, to give her beauty
back to her. And, indeed, she does need it terribly, for all the things
in her that were tolerable, and even agreeable, when she was so pretty,
seem quite different now she is ugly. It is so long since she
thought of using her mind or her natural cleverness, that I really don't
think she has any left now. She is quite aware of all this herself, so
you may imagine how unhappy she is, and how earnestly she begs for your
aid.'",206,tolerable,is the antonym of,intolerable,What's the antonym of intolerable?,Tolerable.
fairy-gifts,3,"'You have told me what I wanted to know,' cried the Fairy, 'but alas! I
cannot help her. My gifts can be given but once.'

Some time passed in all the usual delights of the Flower-Fairy's palace,
and then she sent for Sylvia again. She told her she was to stay for a
little while with the Princess Daphne. Accordingly the butterflies
whisked her off, and set her down in quite a strange kingdom. She
had only been there a very little time before a wandering butterfly
brought a message from her to the Fairy, begging that she might be sent
for as soon as possible. Before very long she was allowed to return.

'Ah! madam,' cried she, 'what a place you sent me to that time!'

'Why, what was the matter?' asked the Fairy. 'Daphne was one of the
princesses who asked for the gift of eloquence, if I remember rightly.'

'And very ill the gift of eloquence becomes a woman,' replied Sylvia,
with an air of conviction. 'It is true that she speaks well, and her
expressions are well chosen. But then she never leaves off talking, and
though at first one may be amused, one ends by being wearied to death.
Above all things she loves any assembly for settling the affairs of her
kingdom. On those occasions she can talk and talk without fear of
interruption. Even then, the moment it is over she is ready to
begin again about anything or nothing, as the case may be. Oh! how glad
I was to come away I cannot tell you.'",269,interruption,is capable of,end_conversation,What happens if a conversation is ended?,An interruption happened.

After allowing her a little time to recover she sent her to the
Court of the Princess Cynthia, where she left her for three months.
At the end of that time Sylvia came back to her with all the joy and
contentment that one feels at being once more beside a dear friend. The
Fairy, as usual, was anxious to hear what she thought of Cynthia, who
had always been amiable, and to whom she had given the gift of pleasing.

'I thought at first,' said Sylvia, 'that she must be the happiest
Princess in the world. She had a thousand lovers who vied with one
another in their efforts to please and gratify her. Indeed, I had nearly
decided that I would ask a similar gift.'

'Have you altered your mind, then?' interrupted the Fairy.

'Yes, indeed, madam,' replied Sylvia. 'and I will tell you why. The
longer I stayed the more I saw that Cynthia was not really happy. In her
desire to please everyone she ceased to be sincere, and degenerated
into a mere coquette. Even her lovers felt that the charms and
fascinations which were exercised upon all who approached her without
distinction were valueless, so that in the end they ceased to care for
them, and went away disdainfully.'

mind at all what she should ask for herself, and the time was drawing
very near. However, before very long the Fairy sent her to Phyllida, and
waited for her report with unabated interest.

'I reached her court safely,' said Sylvia, 'and she received me with
much kindness, and immediately began to exercise upon me that brilliant
wit which you had bestowed upon her. I confess that I was fascinated
by it, and for a week thought that nothing could be more desirable. The
time passed like magic, so great was the charm of her society. But I
ended by ceasing to covet that gift more than any of the others I
have seen, for, like the gift of pleasing, it cannot really give
satisfaction. By degrees I wearied of what had so delighted me at first,
especially as I perceived more and more plainly that it is impossible
to be constantly smart and amusing without being frequently ill-natured,
and too apt to turn all things, even the most serious, into mere
occasions for a brilliant jest.'

Sylvia paused for a moment, and then answered: 'A quiet spirit.' And the
Fairy granted her request.

This lovely gift makes life a constant happiness to its possessor, and
to all who are brought into contact with her. She has all the beauty of
gentleness and contentment in her sweet face. If at times it seems
less lovely through some chance grief or disquietude, the hardest thing
that one ever hears said is:

business of those keys you want!"" said the king. ""And I can scarcely
promise that you will ever see them again."" In spite of this, however,
he was willing to make an attempt, and talked it over with his
servant Unfaithful. ""Why, that is easily done,"" said the latter, ""for
Faithful boasted to me that he could get the queen's keys without any

his head out of the water, recognized him, and asked whether he could
be of any service to him. ""Yes, indeed!"" said the youth, and told him

to the wood that very day with his fiddle, and before long the two
doves were fluttering around him, and shortly after brought back the
bottle filled with the water of life. He took it back home with him

This badger used to come out every night and run across to the farmer's field and spoil the vegetables and the rice which the farmer spent his time in carefully cultivating. The badger at last grew so ruthless in his mischievous work, and did so much harm everywhere on the farm, that the good-natured farmer could not stand it any longer, and determined to put a stop to it.

It was hard to think clearly in his uncomfortable position, for he had been hung upside down. Very near him, at the entrance to the storehouse, looking out towards the green fields and the trees and the pleasant sunshine, stood the farmer's old wife pounding barley. She looked tired and old.

He could hardly believe what he had seen and heard. Then when he understood the whole truth he was so scared and horrified that he fainted right away. After a while he came round and burst into tears. He cried loudly and bitterly. He rocked himself to and fro in his hopeless grief. It seemed too terrible to be real that his faithful old wife had been killed and cooked by the badger while he was working quietly in the fields, knowing nothing of what was going on at home, and congratulating himself on having once for all got rid of the wicked animal who had so often spoiled his fields. And oh! the horrible thought; he had very nearly drunk the soup which the creature had made of his poor old woman. ""Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!"" he wailed aloud. Now, not far away there lived in the same mountain a kind, good-natured old rabbit. He heard the old man crying and sobbing and at once set out to see what was the matter, and if there was anything he could do to help his neighbor. The old man told him all that had happened. When the rabbit heard the story he was very angry at the wicked and deceitful badger, and told the old man to leave everything to him and he would avenge his wife's death.

The next day the weather was fine, and the rabbit went out to find the badger. He was not to be seen in the woods or on the hillside or in the fields anywhere, so the rabbit went to his den and found the badger hiding there, for the animal had been afraid to show himself ever since he had escaped from the farmer's house, for fear of the old man's wrath.

The rabbit led the way miles away from their homes, out on the hills where the grass grew tall and thick and sweet. They both set to work to cut down as much as they could carry home, to store it up for their winter's food.

""Oh, that is nothing."" replied the rabbit; ""I only said 'Crack, crack' because this mountain is called Crackling Mountain.""

The fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badger's back. The badger, hearing the crackle of the burning grass, asked, ""What is that?""

The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once. But no language can describe the agony of the badger as soon as the red pepper had been pasted all over his sore back. He rolled over and over and howled loudly. The rabbit, looking on, felt that the farmer's wife was beginning to be avenged.

The badger was in bed for about a month; but at last, in spite of the red pepper application, his burns healed and he got well.

The badger, who knew nothing about boats, was delighted with his new boat and thought how kind it was of the rabbit to give it to him. They both got into their boats and set out. After going some distance from the shore the rabbit proposed that they should try their boats and see which one could go the quickest. The badger fell in with the proposal, and they both set to work to row as fast as they could for some time. In the middle of the race the badger found his boat going to pieces, for the water now began to soften the clay. He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him. But the rabbit answered that he was avenging the old woman's murder, and that this had been his intention all along, and that he was happy to think that the badger had at last met his deserts for all his evil crimes, and was to drown with no one to help him.

The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes. He said that till now he could never sleep at night or be at peace in the daytime, thinking of how his wife's death was unavenged, but from this time he would be able to sleep and eat as of old.

unceremoniously tumbled, two little elderly women, in black aprons and
white mutches, were busily engaged in grinding corn between two flat

They all stopped their various employments when Farquhar came suddenly
down in their midst. They looked at him in alarm. When they saw that
he was not hurt, they bowed gravely and bade him be seated. Then they
went on with their work and with their play as if nothing had happened.

But Farquhar, being very fond of dancing, and being in no wise anxious
to be seated, thought that he would like to have a reel first. He
asked the Fairies if he might join them. And they, although they looked

thatch.

found nothing but a crop of rank green nettles.

meant. At last he found an old man thatching the roof of a cottage.

patch of mist. As he went nearer he saw that he was a human being,

bind the thatch on the roof.

""Can you tell me anything of my friends, or where my father's cottage is?""
asked Farquhar again. He hardly expected that this second old man would be
able to answer him.

""Oisin, Caoilte, Mac Lughaidh, Diarmuid O'Duibhne, and myself happened

looked around us, and discovered a light-roofed, comfortable-looking

a ram with a white belly, a jet-black head, dark-green horns, and green
feet; and there was in the end of the house a hag covered with a dark
ash-coloured garment. There were no persons in the house except these.
The man at the door-post welcomed us; and we five, having our five
hounds with us, sat on the floor of the bruighean. 'Let submissive
homage be done to Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his people,' said the man at
the door-post. 'My case is that of a man begging a request, but
obtaining neither the smaller nor the greater part of it,' said the
giant. Nevertheless, he rose up and did respectful homage to us. After a
while I became suddenly thirsty, and no person present perceived it but
Caoilte, who began to complain bitterly on that account. 'You have no
cause to complain, Caoilte,' said the man of the door-post, 'but only to
step outside and fetch a drink for Fionn from whichever of the fountains
you please.' Caoilte did so, and fetched the bronze vessel brimful to me
and gave me to drink. I took a drink from it, and the water tasted like
honey while I was drinking, but bitter as gall when I put the vessel
from my lips; so that darting pains and symptoms of death seized me and
agonising pangs from the poisonous draught. I could be but with
difficulty recognised; and the lamentation of Caoilte on account of my
being in that condition was greater than that he had before given vent
to on account of my thirst. The man at the door-post desired Caoilte to
go out and bring me a drink from the other fountain. Caoilte obeyed,
and brought me the iron vessel brimful. I never underwent so much
hardship in battle or conflict as I then suffered while drinking, in
consequence of the bitterness of the draught; but as soon as I put the
vessel from my lips I recovered my own colour and appearance, and that
gave joy and happiness to my people.",250,lip,is part of,mouth,What is outside of your mouth?,Lip.

'It is cooked,' replied the giant, 'and allow me to divide it.' 'How
will you divide it?' said the man of the house. 'I will give one
hindquarter to Fionn and his hounds; the other hindquarter to Fionn's
four men; the forepart to myself; the chine and rump to the old man who
sits at the opposite side of the fire and to the hag in yonder corner;

very unfair so far as I am concerned, for I have been altogether
forgotten.' And so saying, he immediately snatched the quarter that lay
before my four men, and carried it away into a corner, where he began to
devour it. The four men instantly attacked the ram all at once with
their swords, but though they laid on violently, it did not affect him
in the least, and the blows fell away as from a stone or rock, so that
they were forced to resume their seats. 'Upon my veracity, he is doomed

the man of the door-post, 'do you feel surprised at the appearance and

which surprised me more. 'Well, then, I will explain the meaning of all
these things to you,' said the man. 'The giant carrying the grunting hog
between the prongs of the iron fork, whom you first saw, is he who is
yonder, and his name is SLOTH. She who is close to me is the young woman
who had been forcing him along, that is ENERGY; and ENERGY compels SLOTH
forward with her; for ENERGY moves, in the twinkling of the eye, a
greater distance than the foot can travel in a year. The old man of the
bright eyes yonder signifies the WORLD; and he is more powerful than
anyone, which has been proved by his rendering the ram powerless. That
ram which you saw signifies the CRIMES of the man. That hag there beyond
is withering OLD AGE, and her clothing has withered your four men. The
two wells from which you drank the two draughts mean FALSEHOOD and
TRUTH; for while telling a lie one finds it sweet, but it becomes bitter
at the last. Cuanna from Innistuil is my own name. I do not reside here,
but having conceived a wonderful love for you, O Fionn, on account of
your superiority in wisdom and general celebrity, I therefore put those
things into the way before you in order that I might see you. And this

But the king vowed he would sacrifice to the sea-queen the first male creature that came to meet him when he reached land and entered his capital. Thereby the whole fleet reached the harbor in safety. But the five-year old prince, who had not seen his father for the past two years, and who was delighted with the thunder of the cannon as the ships came in, secretly slipped away from his attendants, and ran to the landing. When the king came ashore he was the first to cast himself into his arms, weeping with joy. The king was frightened when he thought of the sea-queen.

But the king and queen never allowed the prince out without a great escort, and he was never permitted to enter a ship, for all his desire to do so. After a few years they gradually forgot the sea-queen, and when the prince was ten years old, a little brother came to join him. Not long after the older of the princes was out walking with his tutor and several other gentlemen. And when they reached the end of the royal gardens by the sea-shore-it was a summer's day, unusually clear-they were suddenly enveloped by a thick cloud, which disappeared as swiftly as it had come. And when it vanished, the prince was no longer there. Nor did he return, to the great sorrow of the king, the queen and the whole country. In the meantime the young prince who was now the sole heir to the crown and kingdom grew up. When he was sixteen, they began to think of finding a wife for him. For the old king and queen wished to see him marry the daughter of some powerful monarch to whom they were allied, before they died.

After eleven at night, because a voice kept crying from out at sea: ""First born, first wed!"" And when some one did venture nearer he did so at the risk of his life. At last these complaints came to the king's ear. He called together his council, and it was decided to question a wise woman, who had already foretold many mysterious happenings, which had all taken place exactly as she had said they would. When the wise woman was brought before the king she said it was the prince who had been taken into the sea who was calling, and that they would have to find him a bride, young, beautiful, and belonging to one of the noblest families of the land, and she must be no less than fifteen and no more than seventeen years old.

At any rate, she said, no phantoms would haunt the place while the building was in progress. Hence no more than four workmen need be employed, and they might first prepare a site, then lay the stone foundation, and finally erect the small house, comprising no more than two pleasant, handsome rooms, one behind the other, and a good floor. The house was carefully erected, and the royal architect himself had to superintend the work, so that everything might be done as well as possible. And while the building was going on, there were no mysterious noises, and every one could travel peacefully along the sea-shore. For that reason the four workmen did not hurry with their work; yet not one of them could stay away for a day, because when they did the tumult along the shore would begin again, and one could hear the cries: ""First born, first wed!""",122,architect,is capable of,build_house,What do architects do?,Architects build houses.

And it was found necessary, though all were unwilling, to follow the wise woman's counsel, and choose three of the loveliest maidens between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, belonging to the first families of the land. They were to be taken to the castle, said the wise woman, and to be treated like ladies of the blood royal, and one after another they were to be sent to the little house by the sea-shore; for should one of them find favor in the eyes of the sea-prince, then the commotion and turmoil would surely cease.

She had only the right to behold what she saw reflected in the mirror in the drawing-room as she lay with her face to the wall.

The poor girl prayed and wept until she grew sleepy; but toward twelve o'clock the outer door suddenly opened, and then the door of the drawing-room. She was startled and filled with fear when, her face turned toward the wall, she saw in the great mirror, how a tall, well-built youth entered, from whose garments the water ran in streams to the floor. He shook himself as though freezing, and said ""Uh hu!"" Then he went to the window, and there laid down an unusually large and handsome apple, and hung a bottle in the casement.

She turned around softly, lest she wake him; but just as she sat up quietly in bed, in order to take a good look at her neighbor, he swiftly seized her right hand, hewed it off, and flung it under the bed. Then he at once lay down and fell asleep again. As soon as it was day, he rose, dressed without casting even a glance at the bed, took the bottle and the apple from the window, went hastily out and locked the door after him.

But he seized her right hand, hewed it off and cast it under the bed, and then laid down again and slept on. At dawn he rose, dressed without casting a glance at the bed, took the apple and the bottle, went out and locked the door after him.

The wise woman accompanied her, and implored her not to turn around; since there was no other means of protection against the spell. The maiden promised to heed her warning, and said that she would pray God to help her if she were plagued with curiosity. All happened as before: the prince came on the stroke of twelve, dripping wet, said ""Uh hu!"" shook himself, laid the apple on the window, hung up the bottle, went into the bed-room, bent over the bed, strode up and down for a few times, said ""Uh hu!"" undressed, and at once fell asleep. The poor girl was half-dead with fear and terror, and prayed and struggled against her curiosity till at length she fell asleep, and did not awake until the prince rose and dressed. He stepped up to the bed, bent over it for a moment, went out, turned at the door and took the bottle and the apple, and then locked the door after him.",55,heed,has subevent,obey,What does it mean to heed?,To heed means to obey.
first-born-first-wed,12,"In the morning the entire court, the girl's parents and the wise woman came to fetch her. She came to meet them weeping with joy, and was conducted to the castle in triumph and with joy indescribable. The king and queen embraced her, and she was paid the same honors destined for the princess who was to arrive in the course of the next few days to marry the heir to the throne. Now the maiden had to sleep every night in the little house by the strand, and every evening the prince came in with his apple and his bottle, and every morning went away at dawn. But it seemed to her that each succeeding evening and morning he looked at her a little longer; though she, always silent, timid, and turned toward the wall, did not dare see more than her mirror showed her of his coming and going. But the two other girls, who had lost their hands, and who now no longer lived in the castle, were jealous of the honor shown the youngest, and threatened to have her done away with if she did not restore their hands.",46,embrace,has subevent,clasp,What does it mean to embrace?,To embrace means to clasp in the arms with affection.

""The maidens twain will see me slain,
Or else have back their hands again!""
But she was to offer no further information nor say another word. With a beating heart the poor girl waited until the prince came, and when he had bent over the bed longer than usual, sighed, then hastily undressed and lain down, the maiden said, quivering and trembling:

Or else have back their hands again!""",101,quiver,has subevent,tremble,What does it mean to quiver?,To quiver means to tremble.

The maiden made no reply and fell asleep. In the morning the prince rose as usual, stepped over to the bed several times and looked at her from its foot; but she did not dare look up, and closed her eyes. He sighed, took his apple; but left the bottle, and went. When the maiden rose she did as he had told her, and in three days' time removed the bandages, and the girls' hands were well and whole.",48,bandage,is a,medical_device,What are bandages?,Bandages are a type of medical device.
first-born-first-wed,15,"Now the foreign princess arrived and the wedding was to be celebrated as soon as possible. Yet she was not fitted out with any more magnificence than the bride of the sea-prince, and both were equally honored by the king and court. This annoyed the two other girls, and they again threatened to have the youngest done away with if she did not let them taste the apple which the prince always brought with him. Again the maiden sought the advice of the wise woman, in whom she had confidence. And that night, when the prince had lain down, she said:

""The maidens twain will see me slain,
Or else your apple they would gain!""",2,foreign,is the antonym of,domestic,What is the opposite of foreign?,Domestic.

And when it stops, pick as many apples as you wish, and return the same way you came."" The maiden made no reply, and fell asleep. On the following morning it seemed harder than ever for the prince to resolve to go away. He appeared excited and restless, sighed often, bent over the maiden several times, went into the living room, then turned around and looked at her once more. Finally, when the sun rose, he hurried out and locked the door after him. When the maiden rose, she could not help weeping, for she had really begun to love the prince.",125,lock,is at location of,door,Where can we find a lock?,We can find a lock on a door.
first-born-first-wed,17,"Then she took the apple, and when she was outside the door, laid it on the ground, and it rolled and rolled, and she followed it, a long, long way, to a region unknown to her. There she came to a high garden wall, over which hung the branches of trees, loaded with beautiful fruit. Finally she reached a great portal, adorned with gold and splendid ornaments, which opened of its own accord as the apple rolled up to it. And the apple rolled through the portal and the maiden followed it into the garden, which was the most beautiful she ever had seen. The apple rolled over to a low-growing tree weighed with the most magnificent apples, and there it stopped. The maiden picked all that her silken apron would hold, and turned to see from which direction she had come, and where the portal stood through which she would have to pass on her way back. But the garden was so lovely that she felt like enjoying its charms a while longer, and without thinking of the prince's words, she touched the apple with her foot, and it began to roll again.",100,portal,is a,entrance,What is a portal?,A portal is an entrance.
first-born-first-wed,18,"Suddenly the portal closed with a great crash. Then the maiden was much frightened, and regretted having done what had been forbidden her; yet now she could not get out, and was compelled to follow the apple once more. It rolled far into the beautiful garden and stopped at a little fire-place, where stood two kettles of water, one small, the other large. There was a great fire burning under the large kettle; but only a weak fire beneath the smaller one. Now when the apple stopped there the maiden did not know what to do. Then it occurred to her to scrape away the fire beneath the large kettle and thrust it under the little one; and soon the kettle over the small fire began to boil and the kettle over the large one simmered down. But she could not stay there. And since she had already disobeyed the order given her, she expected to die, nothing less, and was quite resigned to do so, because she had lost all hope of winning the prince.",143,kettle,is used for,boil_water,What do we do with a kettle?,We boil water with a kettle.
first-born-first-wed,19,"So she gave the apple another push, and it rolled into a meadow in the middle of the garden, and there lay two little children, asleep, with the hot sun beating straight down upon them. The maiden felt sorry for the children, and she took her apron and laid it over them to protect them from[ the sun, and only kept the apples she could put in her little basket. But she could not stay here either, so again she touched the apple, and it rolled on and before she knew it the girl found herself by the sea-shore. There, under a shady tree lay the prince asleep; while beside him sat the sea-queen. Both rose when the maiden drew near, and the prince looked at her with alarm and tenderness in his flashing eyes. Then he leaped into the sea, and the white foam closed over him. But the sea-queen was enraged and seized the girl, who thought that her last moment had struck, and begged for a merciful death. The sea-queen looked at her, and asked her who had given her permission to pass beyond the apple-tree.",77,basket,is used for,carrying,What are baskets used for?,Baskets are used for carring stuff.
first-born-first-wed,20,"The maiden confessed her disobedience, and said that she had done so without meaning any harm, whereupon the sea-queen said she would see how she had conducted herself and punish her accordingly. Thereupon the sea-queen gave the apple a push, and it rolled back through the portal to the apple-tree. The sea-queen saw that the apple-tree was uninjured, again pushed the apple and it rolled on to the little fire-place. But when the sea-queen saw the small kettle boiling furiously, while the large one was growing cold, she became very angry, seized the girl's arm savagely and rising to her full height, asked: ""What have you dared do here? How dared you take the fire from under my kettle and put it under your own?"" The maiden did not know that she had done anything wrong, and said that she did not know why. Then the sea-queen replied: ""The large kettle signified the love between the prince and myself; the small one the love between the prince and you. Since you have taken the fire from under my kettle and laid it under your own, the prince is now violently in love with you, while his love for me is well-nigh extinguished."" ""Look,"" she cried, angrily, ""now my kettle has stopped boiling altogether, and yours is boiling over! But I will see what other harm you have done and punish you accordingly.""",106,savagely,is the antonym of,gently,What is the oppositeof savagely?,Gently.
first-born-first-wed,21,"And the sea-queen again pushed the apple with her foot, and it rolled to the sleeping children, who had been covered with the apron. Then the sea-queen said: ""Did you do that?"" ""Yes,"" replied the maiden, weeping, ""but I meant no harm. I covered the little ones with my apron so that the sun might not burn down on them so fiercely, and I left with them the apples I could not put in my basket."" The sea-queen said: ""This deed and your truthfulness are your salvation. I see that you have a kind heart. These children belong to me and to the prince; but since he now loves you more than he does me, I will resign him to you. Go back to the castle and there say what I tell you: that your wedding with my prince is to be celebrated at the same time as that of his younger brother. And all your jewels, your ornaments, your wedding-dress and your bridal chair, are to be exactly like those of the other princess. From the moment on that the priest blesses the prince and yourself I have no further power over him.",211,priest,is a,leader_of_parish,What is a priest?,A priest is the leader of a parish.

And when you are arrayed in your bridal finery, come to me here, without anyone's knowledge, so that I may see how they have adorned you. Here is the apple which will show you the way without any one being able to tell where you go."" With that the sea-queen parted from her, and gave the apple a push. It rolled out of the garden and to the castle, where the maiden, with mingled joy and terror, delivered the sea-queen's message to the king, and told him what she demanded for the prince. The king gladly promised all that was desired, and great preparations were at once made for the double wedding. Two bridal chairs were set up side by side, two wedding gowns, and two sets of jewels exactly similar were made ready.",158,terror,is a,strong_emotion,What is terror?,Terror is a strong emotion of fear or dread.
first-born-first-wed,23,"When the maiden had been dressed in her bridal finery she pretended to have forgotten something, which she had to fetch from a lower floor, went downstairs with her apple, and laid it on the ground. It at once rolled to the spot by the sea-shore where she had found the sea-queen and the prince, and where the sea-queen was now awaiting her. ""It is well that you have come,"" said the sea-queen, ""for the slightest disobedience would have meant misfortune for you! But how do you look? Are you dressed just as the princess is? And has the princess no better clothes or jewels?"" The maiden answered timidly, that they were dressed exactly alike. Then the sea-queen tore her gown from her body, unclasped the jewels from her hair and flinging them on the ground cried: ""Is that the way the bride of my prince should look!",138,gown,is a,garment,What is a gown?,"A gow is a loose, flowing upper garment."
first-born-first-wed,24,"Since I have given him to you I will give you my bridal outfit as well."" And with that she raised up a sod beneath the great tree, and a shrine adorned with gold and precious stones appeared, from which she drew out her bridal outfit, which fitted the maiden as though made for her. And it was so costly and so covered with gems that the maiden was almost blinded by its radiance. The crown, too, glowed with light, and was set with the most wonderful emeralds, and all was magnificent beyond what any princess had ever worn. ""Now,"" said the sea-queen, when she had finished adorning the maiden, ""now go back to the castle, and show them how I was dressed when I wedded the prince. All this I give as a free gift to you and your descendants; but you must always conduct yourself so that the prince will be content with you, and you must make his happiness your first thought all your life long.""",49,outfit,is made of,clothes,What is outfit?,Outfit is a set of clothes with accessories.

When she was again in the castle, all were astonished at the beauty and costliness of her dress and jewels, in comparison to which those of the other princess were as nothing. The treasures of the whole kingdom would not have sufficed to pay for such a bridal outfit. And none any longer dared envy the lovely maiden, for never had a princess brought a richer bridal dower into the country. Now all went in solemn procession to the church, and the priests stood before the bridal chairs with their books open, and waited for the prince who, according to the sea-queen's word, would not come until the blessing was to be spoken. They waited impatiently, and the king finally told one of the greatest nobles to seat himself in the bridal chair in the prince's place, which he did.",101,church,is a,building,What is a church?,A church is a Christian building of worship.

Now, priest, speak the blessing!"" While the blessing was spoken the prince became quiet again, and then greeted his parents and the whole court with joy, and before all embraced his wife, who now for the first time ventured to take a good look at him. From then on the prince was like any other human being, and in the end he inherited his father's kingdom, and became a great and world-renowned ruler, beloved by his subjects, and adored by his wife.

The huckster could afford this, and therefore the goblin remained with him--which was very shrewd of the goblin.",86,goblin,has context of,fantasy_literature,What detail does goblin have?,Fantasy literature.
goblin-huckster,2,"One evening the student came into the shop through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself; he had no one to send, and therefore he came himself. He obtained what he wished, and then the huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him. The huckster's wife was a woman who could do more than merely nod, for she usually had plenty to say for herself. The student nodded also, as he turned to leave, then suddenly stopped and began reading the piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped. It was a leaf torn out of an old book; a book that ought not to have been torn up, for it was full of poetry.",132,poetry,is a,art,What's poetry?,An art form.

""Indeed I will,"" said the student. ""Give me the book instead of the cheese; I can eat my bread and butter without cheese. It would be a sin to tear up a book like this. You are a clever man and a practical man, but you understand no more about poetry than that cask yonder.""",103,yonder,has context of,dialect,What does it mean to yonder?,Dialect.
goblin-huckster,4,"This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask, but the huckster and the student both laughed, for it was only said in fun. The goblin, however, felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter. As soon as it was night, the shop closed, and every one in bed except the student, the goblin stepped softly into the bedroom where the huckster's wife slept, and took away her tongue, which of course she did not then want. Whatever object in the room he placed this tongue upon, immediately received voice and speech and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do. It could only be used by one object at a time, which was a good thing, as a number speaking at once would have caused great confusion. The goblin laid the tongue upon the cask, in which lay a quantity of old newspapers.",179,cask,is a,vessel,What's cask?,It's a vessel.

Then the goblin placed the tongue on the coffee mill, and how it did go, to be sure! Then he put it on the butter-tub, and the cash-box, and they all expressed the same opinion as the waste-paper tub. A majority must always be respected. ""Now I shall go and tell the student,"" said the goblin.",93,mill,is used for,grinding,What can a mill be used for?,Grinding.
goblin-huckster,6,"With these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret, where the student lived. The student's candle was burning still, and the goblin peeped through the keyhole and saw that he was reading in the torn book which he had bought out of the shop. But how light the room was! From the book shot forth a ray of light which grew broad and full like the stem of a tree, from which bright rays spread upward and over the student's head. Each leaf was fresh, and each flower was like a beautiful female head--some with dark and sparkling eyes and others with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear. The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music. The little goblin had never imagined, much less seen or heard of, any sight so glorious as this. He stood still on tiptoe, peeping in, till the light went out. The student no doubt had blown out his candle and gone to bed, but the little goblin remained standing there, listening to the music which still sounded, soft and beautiful--a sweet cradle song for the student who had lain down to rest.",215,cradle,is a,baby_bed,What's cradle?,A baby bed.

So he went downstairs again to the huckster's shop, and it was a good thing he got back when he did, for the cask had almost worn out the lady's tongue. He had given a description of all that he contained on one side, and was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe what was there, when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the lady. From that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash-box down to the pine-wood logs, formed their opinions from that of the cask.

As soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage, for it seemed to him that the rays of light were strong cables, drawing him up and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole. While there, a feeling of vastness came over him, such as we experience by the ever-moving sea when the storm breaks forth, and it brought tears into his eyes. He did not himself know why he wept, yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears. ""How wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under such a tree!""

The flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat with both hands pressed tightly over his cap, in which the treasure lay. It was then that he understood what feelings were really strongest in his heart and knew exactly which way they tended. Yet, when the fire was extinguished and the goblin again began to reflect, he hesitated, and said at last, ""I must divide myself between the two; I cannot quite give up the huckster, because of the jam.""

gold-tree-and-silver-tree,1,"In bygone days there lived a little Princess named Gold-Tree. She
was one of the prettiest children in the whole world.

Although her mother was dead, she had a very happy life. Her father
loved her dearly, and thought that nothing was too much trouble so long
as it gave his little daughter pleasure. But by and by he married again,
and then the little Princess's sorrows began.

For his new wife, whose name, curious to say, was Silver-Tree, was very
beautiful, but she was also very jealous. She made herself quite
miserable for fear that, some day, she should meet someone who was
better looking than she was herself.",1,bygone,is a,past,What are bygone days?,Bygone days are days in the past.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,2,"When she found that her step-daughter was so very pretty, she took a
dislike to her at once. She was always looking at her and wondering if
people would think her prettier than she was. And because, in her heart
of hearts, she was afraid that they would do so. She was very unkind
indeed to the poor girl.

At last, one day, when Princess Gold-Tree was quite grown up, the two
ladies went for a walk to a little well. It was all surrounded by
trees, in the middle of a deep glen.

Now the water in this well was so clear that everyone who looked into it
saw his face reflected on the surface. The proud Queen loved to come
and peep into its depths, so that she could see her own picture mirrored
in the water.",150,mirror,has subevent,reflect,What can mirrors do?,Mirrors can reflect light.

""Troutie, troutie, answer me this one question,"" said the Queen. ""Am not
I the most beautiful woman in the world?""

""No, indeed, you are not,"" replied the trout promptly, jumping out of
the water, as he spoke, in order to swallow a fly.

""Who is the most beautiful woman, then?"" asked the disappointed Queen. She had expected a far different answer.

""Thy step-daughter, the Princess Gold-Tree, without a doubt,"" said the
little fish. Then, frightened by the black look that came upon the
jealous Queen's face, he dived to the bottom of the well.",91,fly,is a,insect,What is a fly?,A fly is an insect often seen around trash cans.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,4,"It was no wonder that he did so. The Queen's expression was not
pleasant to look at, as she darted an angry glance at her fair young
step-daughter. She was busy picking flowers some little distance away.

Indeed, she was so annoyed at the thought that anyone should say that
the girl was prettier than she was. She quite lost her
self-control. When she reached home she went up, in a violent
passion, to her room, and threw herself on the bed, declaring that she
felt very ill indeed.

It was in vain that Princess Gold-Tree asked her what the matter was,
and if she could do anything for her. She would not let the poor girl
touch her, but pushed her away as if she had been some evil thing. So at
last the Princess had to leave her alone, and go out of the apartment,
feeling very sad indeed.",145,evil,is a,opposite_of_good,What is evil?,Evil is the opposite concept of good.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,5,"By and by the King came home from his hunting. He at once asked for
the Queen. He was told that she had been seized with sudden illness, and
that she was lying on her bed in her own room. No one, not even
the Court Physician, who had been hastily summoned, could make out what
was wrong with her.

In great anxiety--for he really loved her--the King went up to her
bedside. He asked the Queen how she felt, and if there was anything
that he could do to relieve her.",70,anxiety,is a,emotion,What is anxiety?,Anxiety is an emotion of great tension and nervousness.

""No,"" said the King, ""I deserve better words from your mouth than these. You know that I would give tyou anything that you care to ask, even
if it be the half of my Kingdom.""

I can obtain that, I will die, and that speedily.""",107,obtain,has subevent,get,What does it mean to obtain?,To obtain means to get.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,7,"She spoke so wildly, and looked at him in such a strange fashion, that
the poor King really thought that her brain was turned. He was at
his wits' end what to do. He left the room, and paced up and down the
corridor in great distress. At last he remembered that that very
morning the son of a great King had arrived from a country far over the
sea. He asked for his daughter's hand in marriage.

""Here is a way out of the difficulty,"" he said to himself. ""This
marriage pleases me well. I will have it celebrated at once. Then,
when my daughter is safe out of the country, I will send a lad up the
hillside. He shall kill a he-goat. I will have its heart
prepared and dressed, and send it up to my wife. Perhaps the sight of it
will cure her of this madness.""

So he had the strange Prince summoned before him, and told him how the
Queen had taken a sudden illness that had wrought on her brain. This had
caused her to take a dislike to the Princess. It seemed as if it
would be a good thing if, with the maiden's consent, the marriage could
take place at once, so that the Queen might be left alone to recover
from her strange malady.",49,corridor,is a,passageway,What is a corridor?,A corridor is a narrow hall or passageway with rooms leading off it.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,8,"Now the Prince was delighted to gain his bride so easily. The
Princess was glad to escape from her step-mother's hatred, so the
marriage took place at once. The newly wedded pair set off across
the sea for the Prince's country.

Then the King sent a lad up the hillside to kill a he-goat. When it
was killed he gave orders that its heart should be dressed and cooked,
and sent to the Queen's apartment on a silver dish. And the wicked woman
tasted it, believing it to be the heart of her step-daughter. When
she had done so, she rose from her bed and went about the Castle looking
as well and hearty as ever.

I am glad to be able to tell you that the marriage of Princess
Gold-Tree, which had come about in such a hurry, turned out to be a
great success. The Prince whom she had wedded was rich, and great,
and powerful, and he loved her dearly. She was as happy as the day
was long.",121,castle,is a,large_richly_decorated_building,What is a castle?,"A castle is a large, richly decorated building."
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,9,"So things went peacefully on for a year. Queen Silver-Tree was satisfied
and contented, because she thought that her step-daughter was dead. While all the time the Princess was happy and prosperous in her new
home.

But at the end of the year it chanced that the Queen went once more to
the well in the little glen, in order to see her face reflected in the
water.

And it chanced also that the same little trout was swimming backwards
and forwards, just as he had done the year before. And the foolish Queen
determined to have a better answer to her question this time than she
had last.",14,content,has subevent,satisfy,What does it mean to be contented?,To be contented means to be satisfied.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,10,"""Troutie, troutie,"" she whispered, leaning over the edge of the well,
""am not I the most beautiful woman in the world?""

""By my truth, you are not,"" answered the trout, in his very
straightforward way.

""Who is the most beautiful woman, then?"" asked the Queen, her face
growing pale at the thought that she had yet another rival.

""Why, your Majesty's step-daughter, the Princess Gold-Tree, to be sure,""
answered the trout.

The Queen threw back her head with a sigh of relief. ""Well, at any rate,
people cannot admire her now,"" she said. ""It is a year since she
died. I ate her heart for my supper.""

""Are you sure of that, your Majesty?"" asked the trout, with a twinkle
in his eye. ""It seems to me it is but a year since she married the gallant
young Prince who came from abroad to seek her hand. She returned with
him to his own country.""",165,twinkle,has subevent,shine,What does it mean to twinkle?,To twinkle means to shine with a flickering light.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,11,"When the Queen heard these words she turned quite cold with rage. She knew that her husband had deceived her. She rose from her knees
and went straight home to the Palace. She hid her anger as best she
could. She asked him if he would give orders to have the Long Ship made
ready, as she wished to go and visit her dear step-daughter. It was
such a very long time since she had seen her.

The King was somewhat surprised at her request, but he was only too glad
to think that she had got over her hatred towards his daughter. He
gave orders that the Long Ship should be made ready at once.

Soon it was speeding over the water, its prow turned in the direction of
the land where the Princess lived, steered by the Queen herself. She
knew the course that the boat ought to take. She was in such haste
to be at her journey's end that she would allow no one else to take the
helm.",135,prow,is at location of,boat,What is a prow?,A prow is the front part of a boat.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,12,"Now it chanced that Princess Gold-Tree was alone that day. Her
husband had gone a-hunting. And as she looked out of one of the Castle
windows she saw a boat coming sailing over the sea towards the landing
place. She recognised it as her father's Long Ship. She guessed only
too well whom it carried on board.

She was almost beside herself with terror at the thought. She knew
that it was for no good purpose that Queen Silver-Tree had taken the
trouble to set out to visit her. She felt that she would have given
almost anything she possessed if her husband had but been at home. In
her distress she hurried into the servants' hall.

""Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?"" she cried, ""for I see my
father's Long Ship coming over the sea. I know that my step-mother
is on board. And if she hath a chance she will kill me. She hateth
me more than anything else upon earth.""",82,purpose,is a,goal,What is a purpose?,A purpose is a goal.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,13,"Now the servants worshipped the ground that their young Mistress trod
on. She was always kind and considerate to them. When they saw
how frightened she was, and heard her piteous words, they crowded round
her, as if to shield her from any harm that threatened her.

""Do not be afraid, your Highness,"" they cried; ""we will defend thee with
our very lives if need be. But in case thy Lady Step-Mother should have
the power to throw any evil spell over thee, we will lock you in the
great Mullioned Chamber. Then she cannot get nigh thee at all.""

Now the Mullioned Chamber was a strong-room, which was in a part of the
castle all by itself. Its door was so thick that no one could
possibly break through it. The Princess knew that if she were once
inside the room, with its stout oaken door between her and her
step-mother, she would be perfectly safe from any mischief that that
wicked woman could devise.",18,considerate,is the antonym of,inconsiderate,What is the opposite of considerate?,Inconsiderate.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,14,"So she consented to her faithful servants' suggestion, and allowed them
to lock her in the Mullioned Chamber.

So it came to pass that when Queen Silver-Tree arrived at the great door
of the Castle, and commanded the lackey who opened it to take her to his
Royal Mistress. He told her, with a low bow, that that was impossible,
because the Princess was locked in the strong-room of the Castle. She
could not get out, because no one knew where the key was.

(Which was quite true, for the old butler had tied it round the neck of
the Prince's favourite sheep-dog. He had sent him away to the hills to
seek his master.)",42,lackey,is a,servant,What is a lackey?,A lackey is a servant.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,15,"""Take me to the door of the apartment,"" commanded the Queen. ""At least I

see what harm could possibly come from this, did as he was bid.

""If the key is really lost, and thou canst not come out to welcome me,
dear Gold-Tree,"" said the deceitful Queen. ""At least put your little
finger through the keyhole that I may kiss it.""

The Princess did so, never dreaming that evil could come to her through
such a simple action. But it did. For instead of kissing the tiny
finger, her step-mother stabbed it with a poisoned needle. So
deadly was the poison, that, before she could utter a single cry, the
poor Princess fell, as one dead, on the floor.",87,keyhole,is part of,lock,What is a keyhole?,A keyhole is a hole in a lock where the key is inserted.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,16,"When she heard the fall, a smile of satisfaction crept over Queen
Silver-Tree's face. ""Now I can say that I am the handsomest woman in the
world,"" she whispered. She went back to the lackey who stood waiting
at the end of the passage. She told him that she had said all that she
had to say to her daughter, and that now she must return home.

So the man attended her to the boat with all due ceremony, and she set
sail for her own country. No one in the Castle knew that any harm
had befallen their dear Mistress. The Prince came home from his
hunting with the key of the Mullioned Chamber, which he had taken from
his sheep-dog's neck, in his hand.

He laughed when he heard the story of Queen Silver-Tree's visit, and
told the servants that they had done well. Then he ran upstairs to open
the door and release his wife.",175,release,is a,free,What does it mean to release?,To release means to set free.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,17,"But what was his horror and dismay, when he did so, to find her lying
dead at his feet on the floor.

He was nearly beside himself with rage and grief. He knew
that a deadly poison such as Queen Silver-Tree had used would preserve
the Princess's body so that it had no need of burial. He had it laid on
a silken couch and left in the Mullioned Chamber, so that he could go
and look at it whenever he pleased.

He was so terribly lonely, however, that in a little time he married
again. His second wife was just as sweet and as good as the first
one had been. This new wife was very happy. There was only one little
thing that caused her any trouble at all. She was too sensible to
let it make her miserable.",94,lonely,causes,meet_friend,What do people usually do when they feel lonely?,People usually meet friends when they're lonely.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,18,"That one thing was that there was one room in the Castle--a room which
stood at the end of a passage by itself--which she could never enter, as
her husband always carried the key. And as, when she asked him the
reason of this, he always made an excuse of some kind. She made up her
mind that she would not seem as if she did not trust him, so she asked
no more questions about the matter.

But one day the Prince chanced to leave the door unlocked. As he had
never told her not to do so, she went in. There she saw Princess
Gold-Tree lying on the silken couch, looking as if she were asleep.

""Is she dead, or is she only sleeping?"" she said to herself. She
went up to the couch and looked closely at the Princess. And there,
sticking in her little finger, she discovered a curiously shaped needle.

""There hath been evil work here,"" she thought to herself. ""If that
needle be not poisoned, then I know naught of medicine."" And, being
skilled in leechcraft, she drew it carefully out.",207,medicine,is a,drug,What is medicine?,Medicine refers to a drug used to cure diseases.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,19,"In a moment Princess Gold-Tree opened her eyes and sat up. She presently
she had recovered sufficiently to tell the Other Princess the whole
story.

Now, if her step-mother had been jealous, the Other Princess was not
jealous at all. When she heard all that had happened, she clapped
her little hands, crying, ""Oh, how glad the Prince will be. Although
he hath married again, I know that he loves you best.""

That night the Prince came home from hunting looking very tired and sad. What his second wife had said was quite true. Although he loved her
very much, he was always mourning in his heart for his first dear love,
Princess Gold-Tree.",120,mourn,has subevent,grieve,What does mourning mean?,Mourning means to grieve over a death.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,20,"""How sad you are!"" exclaimed his wife, going out to meet him. ""Is there
nothing that I can do to bring a smile to thy face?""

""Nothing,"" answered the Prince wearily, laying down his bow, for he was
too heart-sore even to pretend to be gay.

""Except to give thee back Gold-Tree,"" said his wife mischievously. ""And
that can I do. Thou wilt find her alive and well in the Mullioned
Chamber.""",58,gay,is a,slang_term_for_homosexual,What's another word for gay?,Homosexual.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,21,"Without a word the Prince ran upstairs, and, sure enough, there was his
dear Gold-Tree. She was sitting on the couch ready to welcome him.

He was so overjoyed to see her that he threw his arms round her neck. He kissed her over and over again. He forgot his poor second wife,
who had followed him upstairs, and who now stood watching the meeting
that she had brought about.

She did not seem to be sorry for herself, however. ""I always knew that
thy heart yearned after Princess Gold-Tree,"" she said. ""And it is but
right that it should be so. She was your first love. Since she
has come to life again, I will go back to mine own people.""

""No, indeed you will not,"" answered the Prince. ""It is you who
have brought me this joy. You will stay with us, and we shall all three
live happily together. And Gold-Tree and thee will become great
friends.""",190,friend,is the antonym of,enemy,What is the opposite of friend?,Enemy.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,22,"And so it came to pass. For Princess Gold-Tree and the Other Princess
soon became like sisters. They loved each other as if they had been
brought up together all their lives.

In this manner another year passed away. One evening, in the old
country, Queen Silver-Tree went, as she had done before, to look at her
face in the water of the little well in the glen.",75,glen,is a,valley,What is a glen?,A glen is a narrow vally.

""By my truth, you are not,"" answered the trout, as he had answered on
the two previous occasions.

""And who do you say is the most beautiful woman now?"" asked the
Queen, her voice trembling with rage and vexation.

""I have given her name to thee these two years back,"" answered the
trout. ""The Princess Gold-Tree, of course.""

""But she is dead,"" laughed the Queen. ""I am sure of it this time. It
is just a year since I stabbed her little finger with a poisoned needle. I heard her fall down dead on the floor.""

""I would not be so sure of that,"" answered the trout. Without saying
another word he dived straight down to the bottom of the well.",172,trout,is a,edible_fish,What is a trout?,A trout is an edible fish closely related to salmon.
gold-tree-and-silver-tree,24,"After hearing his mysterious words the Queen could not rest. At last
she asked her husband to have the Long Ship prepared once more, so that
she could go and see her step-daughter.

The King gave the order gladly. It all happened as it had happened
before.

She steered the Ship over the sea with her own hands. When it was

So they both went down to the edge of the water. When Queen

""I will follow the custom gladly,"" answered the Queen, and she raised
the goblet to her mouth. But the Other Princess, who was watching for
closely, noticed that she did not allow the wine that it contained to

He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.

""Shall I love you?"" said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.

""I am the Happy Prince.""

The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.

Little Tschauna was about to be executed in the market place when a messenger came spurring up with a command from the princess's father to pardon him. The princess did not dare to disobey. So he was dismissed to his home after he had sworn to give up all thought of realizing his traitorous plans. I was loaded with benefits as a reward for my victory.

Here the infamous Tschauna harassed me and well-nigh put me to shame. Had not your master's great kindness and your own courage come to my assistance, hard would have been my lot!' Then she began to thank me and her tears of emotion flowed like a stream. I bowed and begged her to grant me leave of absence, so that I might look after my family.

That same day one of his officers was out walking. Suddenly he saw a heavy cloud of dust rising along the highway, while flags and banners darkened the sun. A thousand knights were escorting a man who sat his horse proudly and like a hero. And when the officer looked at his face, it was the general Dschong Tschong-Fu.

Now, this king had a daughter who was as pretty as a ripe apple, so that there was no end to the number of the lads who came asking to marry her. Every day there were two or three of them dawdling around the house, so that at last the old king grew tired of having them always about. 
So he sent word far and near that whoever should befool him might have the princess and half of the kingdom to boot, for he thought that it would be a wise man indeed who could trick him. But the king also said, that whoever should try to befool him and should fail, should have a good whipping. This was to keep all foolish fellows away.

At this they all stared and sniggered. What! he go where his clever brothers had failed, and had nothing to show for the trying but a good beating? What had come over the lout! Here was a pretty business, to be sure! That was what they all said. 
But all of this rolled away from Boots like water from a duck's back. No matter, he would like to go and have a try like the others. So he begged and begged until his father was glad to let him go to be rid of his teasing, if nothing else. 
Then Boots asked if he might have the old tattered hat that hung back of the chimney.",226,chimney,is at location of,roof,Where can we find a chimney?,On the roof.
how-boots-befooled-king,5,"Oh, yes, he might have that if he wanted it, for nobody with good wits was likely to wear such a thing.  So Boots took the hat, and after he had brushed the ashes from his shoes set off for the town, whistling as he went.

""Good-day, mother,"" said Boots. 
""Good-day, son,"" said she. 
""What will you take for all of your pots and crocks?"" said Boots.

""I will give you five shillings if you will come and stand in front of the king's house, and do thus and so when I say this and that,"" said Boots. 
Oh, yes! she would do that willingly enough. 
So Boots and the old woman went on together, and presently came to the king's house.

""Stop! stop!"" cried the king, ""what is all this about?"" 
""Why,"" said Boots, ""everybody wants to buy my cap, but I will not sell it! I will not do it, I say!"" 
""But, why should anybody want to buy such a cap as that?"" said the king. 
""Because,"" said Boots, ""it is a fooling cap and the only one in all of the world.""  
""A fooling cap!"" said the king. For he did not like to hear of such a cap as that coming into the town. ""Hum-m-m-m! I should like to see you fool somebody with it.

No sooner had he spoken these words than the old woman jumped up and began breaking and smashing her pots and crocks as though she had gone crazy. That was what Boots had paid her five shillings for doing, but of it the king knew nothing. ""Hui!"" said he to himself, ""I must buy that hat from the fellow or he will fool the princess away from me for sure and certain."" Then he began talking to Boots as sweetly as though he had honey in his mouth. Perhaps Boots would sell the hat to him? 
Oh, no! Boots could not think of such a thing as selling his fooling cap. 
Come, come; the king wanted that hat, and sooner than miss buying it he would give a whole bag of gold money for it.",144,honey,is a,thick_liquid,What is honey?,"Honey is a sweet, thich fluid produced by bees."

So the king gave Boots the bag of gold, and Boots gave the king the old tattered hat, and then he went his way. 
After Boots had gone the king blew into the hat and blew into the hat, but though he blew enough breath into it to sail a big ship, he did not befool so much as a single titmouse. Then, at last, he began to see that the fooling cap was good on nobody else's head but Boots's; and he was none too pleased at that, you may be sure. 
As for Boots, with his bag of gold he bought the finest clothes that were to be had in the town, and when the next morning had come he started away bright and early for the king's house.

how-boots-befooled-king,9,"At this the king hemmed and hawed and scratched his head. Yes; Boots had befooled him sure enough, but, after all, he could not give up the princess for such a thing as that. Still, he would give Boots another chance. Now, there was the high-councillor, who was the wisest man in all of the world. Did Boots think that he could fool him also? 
Oh, yes! Boots thought that it might be done. 
Very well; if he could befool the high-councillor so as to bring him to the castle the next morning against his will, Boots should have the princess and the half of the kingdom; if he did not do so he should have his beating. 
Then Boots went away, and the king thought that he was rid of him now for good and all. 
As for the high-councillor, he was not pleased with the matter at all, for he did not like the thought of being fooled by a clever rogue, and taken here and there against his will. So when he had come home, he armed all of his servants with blunderbusses, and then waited to give Boots a welcome when he should come.",186,rogue,is a,villain,What is a rogue?,A rogue is a villain unworthy of trust.
how-boots-befooled-king,10,"But Boots was not going to fall into any such trap as that! No indeed! not he! The next morning he went quietly and bought a fine large meal-sack. Then he put a black wig over his beautiful red hair, so that no one might know him. After that he went to the place where the high-councillor lived, and when he had come there he crawled inside of the sack, and lay just beside the door of the house. 
By and by came one of the maid servants to the door, and there lay the great meal-sack with somebody in it. 
""Ach!"" cried she, ""who is there?"" 
But Boots only said, ""Sh-h-h-h-h!"" 
Then the serving maid went back into the house, and told the high-councillor that one lay outside in a great meal-sack, and that all that he said was, ""Sh-h-h-h-h!"" 
So the councillor went himself to see what it was all about. ""What do you want here?"" said he. 
""Sh-h-h-h-h!"" said Boots, ""I am not to be talked to now. This is a wisdom-sack, and I am learning wisdom as fast as a drake can eat peas.""",38,wig,is used for,cover_head,What is a wig?,A wig is a hairpiece used to cover the head.
how-boots-befooled-king,11,"""And what wisdom have you learned?"" said the councillor. 
Oh! Boots had learned wisdom about everything in the world. He had learned that the clever scamp who had fooled the king yesterday was coming with seventeen tall men to take the high-councillor, willy-nilly, to the castle that morning. 
When the high-councillor heard this he fell to trembling till his teeth rattled in his head. ""And have you learned how I can get the better of this clever scamp?"" said he. 
Oh, yes! Boots had learned that easily enough. 
So, good! then if the wise man in the sack would tell the high-councillor how to escape the clever rogue, the high-councillor would give the wise man twenty dollars. 
But no, that was not to be done; wisdom was not bought so cheaply as the high-councillor seemed to think. 
Well, the councillor would give him a hundred dollars then. 
That was good! A hundred dollars were a hundred dollars. If the councillor would give him that much he might get into the sack himself, and then he could learn all the wisdom that he wanted, and more besides.",136,dollar,is a,unit_of_currency,What is dollar?,Dollar is a unit of currency.
how-boots-befooled-king,12,"So Boots crawled out of the sack, and the councillor paid his hundred dollars and crawled in. 
As soon as he was in all snug and safe, Boots drew the mouth of the sack together and tied it tightly. Then he flung sack, councillor, and all over his shoulder, and started away to the king's house, and anybody who met them could see with half an eye that the councillor was going against his will. 
When Boots came to the king's castle he laid the councillor down in the goose-house, and then he went to the king. 
When the king saw Boots again, he bit his lips with vexation. ""Well,"" said he, ""have you fooled the councillor?"" 
""Oh, yes!"" says Boots, ""I have done that."" 
And where was the councillor now? 
Oh, Boots had just left him down in the goose-house. He was tied up safe and sound in a sack, waiting till the king should send for him. 
So the councillor was sent for, and when he came the king saw at once that he had been brought against his will. 
""And now may I marry the princess?"" said Boots.",120,lip,is part of,mouth,What are lips?,Lips are the two fleshy protrusions around the opening of the mouth.
how-boots-befooled-king,13,"But the king was not willing for him to marry the princess yet; no! no! Boots must not go so fast. There was more to be done yet. If he would come to-morrow morning he might have the princess and welcome, but he would have to pick her out from among fourscore other maids just like her; did he think that he could do that? 
Oh, yes! Boots thought that that might be easy enough to do. 
So, good! then come to-morrow; but he must understand that if he failed he should have a good whipping, and be sent packing from the town. 
So off went Boots, and the king thought that he was rid of him now, for he had never seen the princess, and how could he pick her out from among eighty others? 
But Boots was not going to give up so easily as all that! No, not he! He made a little box, and then he hunted up and down until he had caught a live mouse to put into it. 
When the next morning came he started away to the king's house, taking his mouse along with him in the box.",194,mouse,is at location of,hole_in_wall,Where do mice live?,Mice usually live in holes in the wall.

Oh, yes! Boots was back again. And now if the princess was ready he would like to go and find her, for lost time was not to be gathered again like fallen apples. 
So off they marched to a great room, and there stood eighty-and-one maidens, all as much alike as peas in the same dish. 
Boots looked here and there, but, even if he had known the princess, he could not have told her from the others. But he was ready for all that. Before any one knew what he was about, he opened the box, and out ran the little mouse among them all. Then what a screaming, and a hubbub there was! Many looked as though they would have liked to swoon, but only one of them did so. As soon as the others saw what had happened, they forgot all about the mouse, and ran to her and fell to fanning her and slapping her hands and chafing her temples.",101,pea,is a,vegetable,What is a pea?,A pea is a type of vegetable.

how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,1,"A little back from the high road there stands a house which is called
'Hemgard.' Perhaps you remember the two beautiful mountain ash trees by
the reddish-brown palings, and the high gate. Or you remember the garden with the
beautiful barberry bushes which are always the first to become grown
in spring, and which in summer are weighed down with their beautiful
berries.

Behind the garden there is a hedge with tall aspens which rustle in the
morning wind. Behind the hedge is a road, behind the road is a wood, and
behind the wood the wide world.

But on the other side of the garden there is a lake, and beyond the lake
is a village, and all around stretch meadows and fields, now yellow, now
green.

In the pretty house, which has white window-frames, a neat porch and
clean steps, which are always strewn with finely-cut juniper leaves,
Walter's parents live. His brother Frederick, his sister Lotta, old
Lena, Jonah, Caro and Bravo, Putte and Murre, and Kuckeliku.

He cannot read yet, but he can do many other things. He can turn
cartwheels, stand on his head, ride see-saw, throw snowballs, play ball,
crow like a cock, eat bread and butter and drink sour milk, and tear his
trousers. He can wear holes in his elbows, break the crockery in pieces, throw
balls through the windowpanes, draw old men on important papers, walk
over the flower-beds, eat himself sick with gooseberries, and be well
after a whipping. For the rest he has a good heart but a bad memory,
and forgets his father's and his mother's admonitions. He so often gets
into trouble and meets with adventures, as you shall hear, but first of
all I must tell you how brave he was and how he hunted wolves.

Once in the spring, a little before Midsummer, Walter heard that there
were a great many wolves in the wood, and that pleased him. He was
wonderfully brave when he was in the midst of his companions or at home
with his brothers and sister, then he used often to say 'One wolf is
nothing, there ought to be at least four.'

When he wrestled with Klas Bogenstrom or Frithiof Waderfelt and struck
them in the back, he would say 'That is what I shall do to a wolf!' When he shot arrows at Jonas and they rattled against his sheepskin coat
he would say: 'That is how I should shoot you if you were a wolf!'",57,butter,is a,dairy_product,What is butter?,Butter is a dairy product often made of cow's milk.
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,3,"Indeed, some thought that the brave boy boasted a little. One must
indeed believe him since he said so himself. So Jonas and Lena used to
say of him 'Look, there goes Walter, who shoots the wolves.' And other
boys and girls would say 'Look, there goes brave Walter, who is brave
enough to fight with four.'

There was no one so fully convinced of this as Walter himself, and one
day he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt. He took with him his drum,
which had holes in one end since the time he had climbed up on it to
reach a cluster of rowan berries, and his tin sabre, which was a little
broken, because he had with incredible courage fought his way through a
whole unfriendly army of gooseberry bushes.

He did not forget to arm himself quite to the teeth with his pop-gun,
his bow, and his air-pistol. He had a burnt cork in his pocket to
blacken his moustache, and a red cock's feather to put in his cap to
make himself look fierce. He had besides in his trouser pocket a clasp
knife with a bone handle, to cut off the ears of the wolves as soon as
he had killed them. He thought it would be cruel to do that while
they were still living.",126,sabre,is a,sword,What is a sabre?,A sabre is a light sword.
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,4,"It was such a good thing that Jonas was going with corn to the mill, for
Walter got a seat on the load, while Caro ran barking beside them. As
soon as they came to the wood Walter looked cautiously around him to
see perchance there was a wolf in the bushe. He did not omit to
ask Jonas if wolves were afraid of a drum. 'Of course they are' (that is
understood) said Jonas. Thereupon Walter began to beat his drum with all
his might while they were going through the wood.

When they came to the mill Walter immediately asked if there had been
any wolves in the neighbourhood lately.",90,drum,is a,percussion_instrument,What is a drum?,A drum is a percussion instrument.

'Ah!' said Walter, 'do you think that there were many?'

'We don't know,' answered the miller.

'Oh, it is all the same,' said Walter. 'I only asked so that I should
know if I should take Jonas with me.'

'I could manage very well alone with three, but if there were more, I
might not have time to kill them all before they ran away.'

'In Walter's place I should go quite alone, it is more manly,' said
Jonas.

'No, it is better for you to come too,' said Walter. 'Perhaps there are
many.'

'No, I have not time,' said Jonas, 'and besides, there are sure not to
be more than three. Walter can manage them very well alone.'

'Yes,' said Walter, 'certainly I could. But, you see, Jonas, it might
happen that one of them might bite me in the back, and I should have
more trouble in killing them. If I only knew that there were not more
than two I should not mind, for them I should take one in each hand and
give them a good shaking, like Susanna once shook me.'",17,ram,is a,sheep,What is a ram?,A ram is an adult male sheep.

'there are never more than two when they slay children and rams. Walter
can very well shake them without me.'

'But, you see, Jonas,' said Walter, 'if there are two, it might still
happen that one of them escapes and bites me in the leg. You see
I am not so strong in the left hand as in the right. You can very well
come with me, and take a good stick in case there are really two. Look,
if there is only one, I shall take him so with both my hands and thrown
him living on to his back. He can kick as much as he likes, I shall
hold him fast.'

'Now, when I really think over the thing,' said Jonas, 'I am almost sure
there will not be more than one. What would two do with one ram? There
will certainly not be more than one.'

'But you should come with me all the same, Jonas,' said Walter. 'You see
I can very well manage one, but I am not quite accustomed to wolves yet,
and he might tear holes in my new trousers.'

'Well, just listen,' said Jonas, 'I am beginning to think that Walter
is not so brave as people say. First of all Walter would fight against
four, and then against three, then two, and then one, and now Walter
wants help with one. Such a thing must never be. What would people say?
Perhaps they would think that Walter is a coward?'",315,coward,is a,person,What is a coward?,A coward is a person who lacks courage.
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,7,"'That's a lie,' said Walter, 'I am not at all frightened, but it is
more amusing when there are two. I only want someone who will see how I
strike the wolf and how the dust flies out of his skin.'

'Well, then, Walter can take the miller's little Lisa with him. She can
sit on a stone and look on,' said Jonas.

'No, she would certainly be frightened,' said Walter, 'and how would
it do for a girl to go wolf-hunting? Come with me, Jonas, and you shall
have the skin, and I will be content with the ears and the tail.'

'No, thank you,' said Jonas, 'Walter can keep the skin for himself. Now
I see quite well that he is frightened. Fie, shame on him!'",21,amuse,has subevent,entertain,What does it mean to amuse?,To amuse means to entertain in a pleasant manner.
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,8,"This touched Walter's pride very near. 'I shall show that I am not
frightened,' he said. And so he took his drum, sabre, cock's feather,
clasp-knife, pop-gun and air-pistol, and went off quite alone to the
wood to hunt wolves.

It was a beautiful evening, and the birds were singing in all the
branches. Walter went very slowly and cautiously. At every step he
looked all round him to see if perchance there was anything lurking
behind the stones. He quite thought something moved away there in the

little before I go there,' thought Walter.

Br-r-r, so he began to beat his drum. Then something moved again. Caw!
caw! a crow flew up from the ditch. Walter immediately regained courage.
'It was well I took my drum with me,' he thought, and went straight on
with courageous steps. Very soon he came quite close to the kiln, where
the wolves had killed the ram. But the nearer he came the more dreadful
he thought the kiln looked. It was so gray and old. Who knew how many
wolves there might be hidden there? Perhaps the very ones which killed
the ram were still sitting there in a corner. Yes, it was not at
all safe here, and there were no other people to be seen in the
neighbourhood. It would be horrible to be eaten up here in the daylight,
thought Walter to himself. The more he thought about it the uglier
and grayer the old kiln looked, and the more horrible and dreadful it
seemed to become the food of wolves.",158,ditch,is a,waterway,What is a ditch?,A ditch is a long and shallow waterway for irrigation or drainage.

Walter. 'Fie!' said his conscience, 'Do you not remember that a lie is
one of the worst sins, both in the sight of God and man? If you tell a
lie to-day and say you struck a wolf, to-morrow surely it will eat you
up.'

'No, I will go to the kiln,' thought Walter, and so he went. But he
did not go quite near. He went only so near that he could see the ram's
blood which coloured the grass red, and some tufts of wool which the
wolves had torn from the back of the poor animal.

It looked so dreadful.

'I wonder what the ram thought when they ate him up,' thought Walter
to himself. Just then a cold shiver ran through him from his collar
right down to his boots.

'It is better for me to beat the drum,' he thought to himself again, and
so he began to beat it. But it sounded horrid, and an echo came out
from the kiln that seemed almost like the howl of a wolf. The drumsticks
stiffened in Walter's hands, and he thought now they are coming...!",223,drumstick,is a,stick,What is a drumstick?,A drumstick is a stick used to play drums.

out from under the kiln!

What did Walter do now? Yes, the brave Walter who alone could manage
four, threw his drum far away, took to his heels and ran. He ran as
fast as he could back to the mill.

But, alas! the wolf ran after him. Walter looked back; the wolf was
quicker than he and only a few steps behind him. Then Walter ran faster.
But fear got the better of him, he neither heard nor saw anything more.
He ran over sticks, stones and ditches. He lost drum-sticks, sabre,
bow, and air-pistol, and in his terrible hurry he tripped over a tuft of
grass. There he lay, and the wolf jumped on to him....

It was a gruesome tale! Now you may well believe that it was all over
with Walter and all his adventures. That would have been a pity. But do
not be surprised if it was not quite so bad as that, for the wolf was
quite a friendly one. He certainly jumped on to Walter, but he only
shook his coat and rubbed his nose against his face. Walter
shrieked. Yes, he shrieked terribly!",141,tuft,is a,bunch,What is a tuft?,"A tuft is a bunch of feathers, grass or hair held together at the base."

'Where is the wolf?' said Jonas. 'I don't see any wolf.'

'Take care, he is here, he has bitten me to death,' groaned Walter.

Then Jonas began to laugh. Yes, he laughed so that he nearly burst his
skin belt.

Well, well, was that the wolf? Was that the wolf which Walter was to
take by the neck and shake and throw down on its back, no matter how
much it struggled? Just look a little closer at him: he is your old
friend, your own good old Caro. I quite expect he found a leg of the ram
in the kiln. When Walter beat his drum, Caro crept out, and when Walter

killed him....'

'I! You shall see, Jonas, when we next meet a bear. You see I like so

But, no, she would have nothing to do with any of them; this one was too young and that one was too old; this one was too lean and that one was too fat; this one was too little and that one was too big; this one was too dark and that one was too fair. So there was never a white sheep in the whole flock, as one might say. 
Now there was one came who was a king in his own country, and a fine one at that. The only blemish about him was a mole on his chin; apart from that he was as fresh as milk and rose leaves.

Well, yes; they were wanting a gooseherd, and if he liked the place he might have it. 
Oh, that fitted his wants like a silk stocking, and the next day he drove the geese up on the hill back of the king's house, so that they might eat grass where it was fresh and green.

The princess sat at her window, and it was not long before she saw it, I can tell you. Dear, dear, but it was a pretty one, the golden ball.

But, no; the gooseherd would not come at the princess's bidding. If she wanted to buy the golden ball she must come up on the hill and pay him, for he was not going to leave his flock of geese, and have them waddling into the garden perhaps; that is what the gooseherd said.

time, and grew so hungry, so thirsty and so weary that he did not know
what to do. The most part he sat with the rudder in his hand and
slept. But all of a sudden the boat ran up on a beach and stopped. Then
Isaac opened his eyes. The sun broke through the fog, and shone on a
beautiful land. Its hills and mountains were green to their very tops,
fields and meadows lay among their slopes. He seemed to breathe a
fragrance of flowers and grass sweeter than any he had ever known
before.",125,rudder,is a,boat_or_ship_part,What is a rudder?,A rudder is a part of a boat or a ship used to control direction.
isle-of-udrost,4,"""God be praised, now I am safe, for this is Udrost!"" said Isaac to
himself. Directly ahead of him lay a field of barley, with ears so
large and heavy that he had never seen their like. Through the
barley-field a narrow path led to a green turf-roofed cottage of clay,
that rose above the field. On the roof of the cottage grazed a white
goat with gilded horns, and an udder as large as that of the largest
cow. Before the door sat a little man clad in blue, puffing away at a
little pipe. He had a beard so long and so large that it hung far down
upon his breast.",29,barley,is a,cereal,What is barley?,Barley is a kind of cereal.
isle-of-udrost,5,"""Welcome to Udrost, Isaac!"" said the man.

""Good day to you, father,"" said Isaac, ""and do you know me?""

""It might be that I do,"" said the man. ""I suppose you want to stay here
overnight?""

""That would suit me very well, father,"" was Isaac's reply.

""The trouble is with my sons, for they cannot bear the smell of a
Christian,"" answered the man. ""Did you meet them?""

""No, I only met three cormorants, who were sitting on a piece of
drift-wood and croaking,"" was Isaac's reply.

""Well, those were my sons,"" said the man, and emptied his pipe, ""and now
come into the house, for I think you must be hungry and thirsty.""

""I'll take that liberty, father,"" said Isaac.",110,cormorant,is a,seabird,What is a cormorant?,A cormorant is a kind of medium-large black seabird.
isle-of-udrost,6,"When the man opened the door, everything within was so beautiful that
Isaac could not get over his admiration. He had never seen anything like
it. The table was covered with the finest dishes, bowls of cream, and
salmon and game, and liver dumplings with syrup, and cheese as well, and
there were whole piles of doughnuts, and there was mead, and everything
else that is good. Isaac ate and drank bravely, and yet his plate was
never empty. No matter how much he drank, his glass was always
full. The man neither ate much nor said much; but suddenly they heard a
noise and clamor before the house, and the man went out. After a time he
returned with his three sons, and Isaac trembled inwardly when they came
through the door. Their father must have quieted them, for they were
very friendly and amiable, and told Isaac he must use his guest-right,
and sit down and drink with them; for Isaac had risen to leave the
table, saying he had satisfied his hunger. But he gave in to them, and
they drank mead together, and became good friends. And they said that
Isaac must go fishing with them, so that he would have something to take
with him when he went home.",51,syrup,is a,liquid,What is syrup?,Syrup refers to any thick liquid that has a high suger content.
isle-of-udrost,7,"The first time they put out a great storm was raging. One of the
sons sat at the rudder, the second at the bow, and the third in the
middle. Isaac had to work with the bailing-can until he dripped
perspiration. They sailed as though they were mad. They never reefed a
sail, and when the boat was full of water, they danced on the crests of
the waves, and slid down them so that the water in the stern spurted up
like a fountain. After a time the storm subsided, and they began to
fish. And the sea was so full of fish that they could not even put out
an anchor, since mountains of fish were piled up beneath them. The sons
of Udrost drew up one fish after another. Isaac knew his business; but
he had taken along his own fishing-tackle, and as soon as a fish bit he
let go again, and at last he had caught not a single one. When the boat
was filled, they sailed home again to Udrost, and the sons cleaned the
fish, and laid them on the stands. Meanwhile Isaac had complained to
their father of his poor luck. The man promised that he should do better
next time, and gave him a couple of hooks. The next time they went
out to fish, Isaac caught just as many as the others, and when they
reached home, he was given three stands of fish as his share.",63,boat,is used for,travel,What do we use to travel on water?,We use boats to travel on water.
isle-of-udrost,8,"At length Isaac began to get homesick. When he was about to leave,
the man made him a present of a new fishing-boat, full of meal, and
tackle and other useful things. Isaac thanked him repeatedly, and the
man invited him to come back when the season opened again, since he
himself was going to take a cargo to Bergen, in the second stevne,
and Isaac could go along and sell his fish there himself. Isaac was more
than willing, and asked him what course he should set when he again
wanted to reach Udrost. ""All you need do is to follow the cormorant when
he heads for the open sea, then you will be on the right course,"" said
the man. ""Good luck on your way!""",52,season,is part of,year,How many seasons are there in a year?,Four.
isle-of-udrost,9,"But when Isaac got underway, and looked around, there was no Udrost in
sight. Far and wide, all around him, he saw no more than the ocean.

When the time came, Isaac sailed to join the man of Udrost's
fishing-craft. But such a craft he had never seen before. It was two
hails long, so that when the steersman, who was on look-out in the
stern, wanted to call out something to the rower, the latter could not
hear him. So they had stationed another man in the middle of the ship,
close by the mast, who had to relay the steersman's call to the rower,
and even he had to shout as loudly as he could in order to make
himself heard.",122,rower,is capable of,row_canoe,What are rowers capable of?,Rowers are capable of rowing canoes.
isle-of-udrost,10,"Isaac's share was laid down in the forepart of the boat; and he himself
took down the fish from the stands; yet he could not understand how it
was that the stands were continually filled with fresh fish, no matter
how many he took away, and when he sailed away they were still as full
as ever. When he reached Bergen, he sold his fish, and got so much money
for them that he was able to buy a new schooner, completely fitted out,
and with a cargo to boot, as the man of Udrost had advised him. Late in
the evening, when he was about to sail for home, the man came aboard
and told him never to forget those who survived his neighbor, for his
neighbor himself had died. Then he wished Isaac all possible success
and good fortune for his schooner, in advance. ""All is well, and all
stands firm that towers in the air,"" said he, and what he meant was that
there was one aboard whom none could see, but who would support the mast
on his back, if need be.",88,schooner,is a,sailing_vessel,What is a schooner?,A schooner is a sailing vessel with two or more masts.
isle-of-udrost,11,"Since that time fortune was Isaac's friend. And well he knew why this
was so, and never forgot to prepare something good for whoever held the
winter watch, when the schooner was drawn up on land in the fall. And
every Christmas night there was the glow and shimmer of light, the
sound of fiddles and music, of laughter and merriment, and of dancing on
the deserted schooner.",60,fiddle,is a,stringed_musical_instrument,What is a fiddle?,A fiddle is a stringed musical instrument similar to a violin.
jack-my-hedgehog,1,"There was once a farmer who lived in great comfort. He had both lands
and money, but, though he was so well off, one thing was wanting to
complete his happiness; he had no children. Many and many a time, when
he met other farmers at the nearest market town, they would teaze him,
asking how it came about that he was childless. At length he grew so
angry that he exclaimed: 'I must and will have a child of some sort or
kind, even should it only be a hedgehog!'

Not long after this his wife gave birth to a child, but though the lower
half of the little creature was a fine boy, from the waist upwards it
was a hedgehog, so that when his mother first saw him she was quite
frightened, and said to her husband, 'There now, you have cursed the
child yourself.' The farmer said, 'What's the use of making a fuss? I
suppose the creature must be christened, but I don't see how we are to
ask anyone to be sponsor to him, and what are we to call him?'

'There is nothing we can possibly call him but Jack my Hedgehog,'
replied the wife.",14,land,is at location of,ocean,What is the part of Earth which is not covered by oceans?,The land.
jack-my-hedgehog,2,"So they took him to be christened, and the parson said: 'You'll never
be able to put that child in a decent bed on account of his prickles.'
Which was true, but they shook down some straw for him behind the stove,
and there he lay for eight years. His father grew very tired of him and
often wished him dead, but he did not die, but lay on there year after
year.

Now one day there was a big fair at the market town to which the farmer
meant to go, so he asked his wife what he should bring her from it.
'Some meat and a couple of big loaves for the house,' said she. Then he
asked the maid what she wanted, and she said a pair of slippers and some
stockings. Lastly he said, 'Well, Jack my Hedgehog, and what shall I
bring you?'

'Daddy,' said he, 'do bring me a bagpipe.' When the farmer came home he
gave his wife and the maid the things they had asked for, and then he
went behind the stove and gave Jack my Hedgehog the bagpipes.",121,couple,is a,two,What is a couple?,Two of the same kind connected or considered together.
jack-my-hedgehog,3,"When Jack had got his bagpipes he said, 'Daddy, do go to the smithy and
have the house cock shod for me; then I'll ride off and trouble you no
more.' His father, who was delighted at the prospect of getting rid of
him, had the cock shod, and when it was ready Jack my Hedgehog mounted
on its back and rode off to the forest, followed by all the pigs and
asses which he had promised to look after.

Having reached the forest he made the cock fly up to the top of a very
tall tree with him, and there he sat looking after his pigs and donkeys,
and he sat on and on for several years till he had quite a big herd; but
all this time his father knew nothing about him.",45,prospect,has subevent,search,What can support the search for something?,The prospect of success.
jack-my-hedgehog,4,"As he sat up in his tree he played away on his pipes and drew the
loveliest music from them. As he was playing one day a King, who had
lost his way, happened to pass close by, and hearing the music he was
much surprised, and sent one of his servants to find out where it
came from. The man peered about, but he could see nothing but a little
creature which looked like a cock with a hedgehog sitting on it, perched
up in a tree. The King desired the servant to ask the strange creature
why it sat there, and if it knew the shortest way to his kingdom.

On this Jack my Hedgehog stepped down from his tree and said he would
undertake to show the King his way home if the King on his part would
give him his written promise to let him have whatever first met him on
his return.

The King thought to himself, 'That's easy enough to promise. The
creature won't understand a word about it, so I can just write what I
choose.'",67,peer,has subevent,look,What is peer?,"To look with difficulty, or as if searching for something."
jack-my-hedgehog,5,"So he took pen and ink and wrote something, and when he had done Jack my
Hedgehog pointed out the way and the King got safely home.

Now when the King's daughter saw her father returning in the distance
she was so delighted that she ran to meet him and threw herself into
his arms. Then the King remembered Jack my Hedgehog, and he told his
daughter how he had been obliged to give a written promise to bestow
whatever he first met when he got home on an extraordinary creature
which had shown him the way. The creature, said he, rode on a cock
as though it had been a horse, and it made lovely music, but as it
certainly could not read he had just written that he would _not_ give
it anything at all. At this the Princess was quite pleased, and said how
cleverly her father had managed, for that of course nothing would induce
her to have gone off with Jack my Hedgehog.",171,induce,is the antonym of,deduce,What is the opposite of induce?,Deduce.
jack-my-hedgehog,6,"Meantime Jack minded his asses and pigs, sat aloft in his tree, played
his bagpipes, and was always merry and cheery. After a time it so
happened that another King, having lost his way, passed by with his
servants and escort, wondering how he could find his way home, for the
forest was very vast. He too heard the music, and told one of his men to
find out whence it came. The man came under the tree, and looking up to
the top there he saw Jack my Hedgehog astride on the cock.

The servant asked Jack what he was doing up there. 'I'm minding my pigs
and donkeys; but what do you want?' was the reply. Then the servant told
him they had lost their way, and wanted some one to show it them. Down
came Jack my Hedgehog with his cock, and told the old King he would show
him the right way if he would solemnly promise to give him the first
thing he met in front of his royal castle.

The King said 'Yes,' and gave Jack a written promise to that effect.",213,effect,has subevent,cause,What is an effect?,The result or outcome of a cause.
jack-my-hedgehog,7,"Then Jack rode on in front pointing out the way, and the King reached
his own country in safety.

Now he had an only daughter who was extremely beautiful, and who,
delighted at her father's return, ran to meet him, threw her arms round
his neck and kissed him heartily. Then she asked where he had been
wandering so long, and he told her how he had lost his way and might
never have reached home at all but for a strange creature, half-man,
half-hedgehog, which rode a cock and sat up in a tree making lovely
music, and which had shown him the right way. He also told her how he
had been obliged to pledge his word to give the creature the first
thing which met him outside his castle gate, and he felt very sad at the
thought that she had been the first thing to meet him.

But the Princess comforted him, and said she should be quite willing to
go with Jack my Hedgehog whenever he came to fetch her, because of the
great love she bore to her dear old father.",170,comfort,is at location of,home,Where can we get comfort?,At home.
jack-my-hedgehog,8,"Jack my Hedgehog continued to herd his pigs, and they increased in
number till there were so many that the forest seemed full of them. So
he made up his mind to live there no longer, and sent a message to his
father telling him to have all the stables and outhouses in the village
cleared, as he was going to bring such an enormous herd that all who
would might kill what they chose. His father was much vexed at this
news, for he thought Jack had died long ago. Jack my Hedgehog mounted
his cock, and driving his pigs before him into the village, he let every
one kill as many as they chose, and such a hacking and hewing of pork
went on as you might have heard for miles off.

Then said Jack, 'Daddy, let the blacksmith shoe my cock once more; then
I'll ride off, and I promise you I'll never come back again as long as
I live.' So the father had the cock shod, and rejoiced at the idea of
getting rid of his son.",133,pork,is at location of,refrigerator,Where should pork be stored?,In the refrigerator.
jack-my-hedgehog,9,"Then Jack my Hedgehog set off for the first kingdom, and there the King
had given strict orders that if anyone should be seen riding a cock
and carrying a bagpipe he was to be chased away and shot at, and on no
account to be allowed to enter the palace. So when Jack my Hedgehog rode
up the guards charged him with their bayonets, but he put spurs to his
cock, flew up over the gate right to the King's windows, let himself
down on the sill, and called out that if he was not given what had been
promised him, both the King and his daughter should pay for it with
their lives. Then the King coaxed and entreated his daughter to go with
Jack and so save both their lives.

The Princess dressed herself all in white, and her father gave her a
coach with six horses and servants in gorgeous liveries and quantities
of money. She stepped into the coach, and Jack my Hedgehog with his cock
and pipes took his place beside her. They both took leave, and the King
fully expected never to set eyes on them again. But matters turned out
very differently from what he had expected, for when they had got
a certain distance from the town Jack tore all the Princess's smart
clothes off her, and pricked her all over with his bristles, saying:
'That's what you get for treachery. Now go back, I'll have no more to
say to you.' And with that he hunted her home, and she felt she had been
disgraced and put to shame till her life's end.",87,window,is a,opening,What is the window?,An opening to allow light and air from outside to enter a building.
jack-my-hedgehog,10,"Then Jack my Hedgehog rode on with his cock and bagpipes to the country
of the second King to whom he had shown the way. Now this King had given
orders that, in the event of Jack's coming the guards were to present
arms, the people to cheer, and he was to be conducted in triumph to the
royal palace.

When the King's daughter saw Jack my Hedgehog, she was a good deal
startled, for he certainly was very peculiar looking; but after all she
considered that she had given her word and it couldn't be helped. So she
made Jack welcome and they were betrothed to each other, and at dinner
he sat next her at the royal table, and they ate and drank together.",132,table,is used for,putting_things_on,What is the furniture used for putting things on?,The table.
jack-my-hedgehog,11,"When they retired to rest the Princess feared lest Jack should kiss her
because of his prickles, but he told her not to be alarmed as no harm
should befall her. Then he begged the old King to place a watch of four
men just outside his bedroom door, and to desire them to make a big
fire. When he was about to lie down in bed he would creep out of his
hedgehog skin, and leave it lying at the bedside; then the men must
rush in, throw the skin into the fire, and stand by till it was entirely
burnt up.

And so it was, for when it struck eleven, Jack my Hedgehog went to his
room, took off his skin and left it at the foot of the bed. The men
rushed in, quickly seized the skin and threw it on the fire, and
directly it was all burnt Jack was released from his enchantment and
lay in his bed a man from head to foot, but quite black as though he had
been severely scorched.",194,scorch,is a,burn,What is scorch?,A slight burn.
jack-my-hedgehog,12,"The King sent off for his physician in ordinary, who washed Jack all
over with various essences and salves, so that he became white and was a
remarkably handsome young man. When the King's daughter saw him she was
greatly pleased, and next day the marriage ceremony was performed, and
the old King bestowed his kingdom on Jack my Hedgehog.

After some years Jack and his wife went to visit his father, but the
farmer did not recognize him, and declared he had no son; he had had
one, but that one was born with bristles like a hedgehog, and had gone
off into the wide world. Then Jack told his story, and his old father
rejoiced and returned to live with him in his kingdom.",51,ceremony,is at location of,church,Where do we hold the religious ceremony?,In churches.

It was no mean dwelling that was to be honoured by the fairy visit, but

lived an old woman quite alone, for she was an enchantress. In the
day-time she changed herself into a cat or a night-owl, but in the
evening she became like an ordinary woman again. She could entice
animals and birds to come to her, and then she would kill and cook them.
If any youth came within a hundred paces of the castle, he was obliged
to stand still, and could not stir from the spot till she set him free;
but if a pretty girl came within this boundary, the old enchantress
changed her into a bird, and shut her up in a wicker cage, which she put

delight was to be together, and so that they might get a good long
talk, they went one evening for a walk in the wood. 'Take care,' said

mountain and half was behind it when Joringel looked through the trees
and saw the old wall of the castle quite near them. He was terrified and

or speak, or move hand or foot. Now the sun set; the owl flew into
a bush, and immediately an old, bent woman came out of it; she was
yellow-skinned and thin, and had large red eyes and a hooked nose,

was furious, and breathed out poison and gall at him, but she could not

king-kojata,1,"There was once upon a time a king called Kojata, whose beard was so
long that it reached below his knees. Three years had passed since his
marriage, and he lived very happily with his wife, but Heaven granted
him no heir, which grieved the King greatly. One day he set forth
from his capital, in order to make a journey through his kingdom.
He travelled for nearly a year through the different parts of his
territory, and then, having seen all there was to be seen, he set forth
on his homeward way. As the day was very hot and sultry he commanded his
servants to pitch tents in the open field, and there await the cool of
the evening. Suddenly a frightful thirst seized the King, and as he saw
no water near, he mounted his horse, and rode through the neighbourhood
looking for a spring. Before long he came to a well filled to the brim
with water clear as crystal, and on the bosom of which a golden jug was
floating. King Kojata at once tried to seize the vessel, but though he
endeavoured to grasp it with his right hand, and then with his left, the
wretched thing always eluded his efforts and refused to let itself be
caught. First with one hand, and then with two, did the King try to
seize it, but like a fish the goblet always slipped through his fingers
and bobbed to the ground only to reappear at some other place, and mock
the King.",120,tent,is a,shelter,What is a tent?,A tent is a simple shelter.

plunged his face, beard and all, right into the crystal mirror. But when
he had satisfied his thirst, and wished to raise himself up, he couldn't
lift his head, because someone held his beard fast in the water. 'Who's
there? let me go!' cried King Kojata, but there was no answer; only an
awful face looked up from the bottom of the well with two great green
eyes, glowing like emeralds, and a wide mouth reaching from ear to ear
showing two rows of gleaming white teeth, and the King's beard was held,
not by mortal hands, but by two claws. At last a hoarse voice sounded
from the depths. 'Your trouble is all in vain, King Kojata; I will only
let you go on condition that you give me something you know nothing
about, and which you will find on your return home.'

The King didn't pause to ponder long, 'for what,' thought he, 'could be
in my palace without my knowing about it--the thing is absurd;' so he
answered quickly:

'Yes, I promise that you shall have it.'

The voice replied, 'Very well; but it will go ill with you if you fail
to keep your promise.' Then the claws relaxed their hold, and the face
disappeared in the depths. The King drew his chin out of the water,
and shook himself like a dog; then he mounted his horse and rode
thoughtfully home with his retinue.",293,chin,is part of,face,What is a chin?,A chin is the bottom part of a face.
king-kojata,3,"When they approached the capital, all the people came out to meet them with great joy and acclamation,
and when the King reached his palace the Queen met him on the threshold;
beside her stood the Prime Minister, holding a little cradle in his
hands, in which lay a new-born child as beautiful as the day. Then
the whole thing dawned on the King, and groaning deeply he muttered to
himself 'So this is what I did not know about,' and the tears rolled
down his cheeks. All the courtiers standing round were much amazed at
the King's grief, but no one dared to ask him the cause of it. He took
the child in his arms and kissed it tenderly; then laying it in its
cradle, he determined to control his emotion and began to reign again as
before.

The secret of the King remained a secret, though his grave, careworn
expression escaped no one's notice. In the constant dread that his child
would be taken from him, poor Kojata knew no rest night or day. However,
time went on and nothing happened. Days and months and years passed, and
the Prince grew up into a beautiful youth, and at last the King himself
forgot all about the incident that had happened so long ago.",72,groan,has subevent,utter,What is a groan?,"A groan is a low, mournful sound uttered in pain."
king-kojata,4,"One day the Prince went out hunting, and going in pursuit of a wild boar
he soon lost the other huntsmen, and found himself quite alone in the
middle of a dark wood. The trees grew so thick and near together that it
was almost impossible to see through them, only straight in front of
him lay a little patch of meadowland. Overgrown with thistles and rank
weeds, in the centre of which a leafy lime tree reared itself.
Suddenly a rustling sound was heard in the hollow of the tree, and an
extraordinary old man with green eyes and chin crept out of it.

'A fine day, Prince Milan,' he said; 'you've kept me waiting a good
number of years; it was high time for you to come and pay me a visit.'

'Who are you, in the name of wonder?' demanded the astonished Prince.

'You'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime do as I bid you. Greet
your father King Kojata from me, and don't forget to remind him of his
debt; the time has long passed since it was due, but now he will have to
pay it. Farewell for the present; we shall meet again.'

With these words the old man disappeared into the tree, and the Prince
returned home rather startled, and told his father all that he had seen
and heard.

The King grew as white as a sheet when he heard the Prince's story, and
said, 'Woe is me, my son! The time has come when we must part,' and with

king-kojata,5,"'Don't worry or distress yourself, dear father,' answered Prince Milan.
'Things are never as bad as they look. Only give me a horse for my
journey, and I wager you'll soon see me back again.'

The King gave him a beautiful charger, with golden stirrups, and a
sword. The Queen hung a little cross round his neck, and after much
weeping and lamentation the Prince bade them all farewell and set forth
on his journey.

He rode straight on for two days, and on the third he came to a lake as
smooth as glass and as clear as crystal. Not a breath of wind moved, not
a leaf stirred, all was silent as the grave, only on the still bosom of
the lake thirty ducks, with brilliant plumage, swam about in the water.
Not far from the shore Prince Milan noticed thirty little white garments
lying on the grass, and dismounting from his horse, he crept down under
the high bulrushes, took one of the garments and hid himself with it
behind the bushes which grew round the lake. The ducks swam about all
over the place, dived down into the depths and rose again and glided
through the waves. At last, tired of disporting themselves, they swam
to the shore, and twenty-nine of them put on their little white garments
and instantly turned into so many beautiful maidens. Then they finished
dressing and disappeared. Only the thirtieth little duck couldn't
come to the land; it swam about close to the shore, and, giving out a
piercing cry, it stretched its neck up timidly, gazed wildly around, and
then dived under again.",55,stirrup,is a,device,What is a stirrup?,A stirrup is a device that assists horseriding.
king-kojata,6,"Prince Milan's heart was so moved with pity for
the poor little creature that he came out from behind the bulrushes, to
see if he could be of any help. As soon as the duck perceived him, it
cried in a human voice, 'Oh, dear Prince Milan, for the love of Heaven
give me back my garment, and I will be so grateful to you.' The Prince
lay the little garment on the bank beside her, and stepped back into the
bushes. In a few seconds a beautiful girl in a white robe stood before
him, so fair and sweet and young that no pen could describe her. She
gave the Prince her hand and spoke.

'Many thanks, Prince Milan, for your courtesy. I am the daughter of a
wicked magician, and my name is Hyacinthia. My father has thirty young
daughters, and is a mighty ruler in the underworld, with many castles
and great riches. He has been expecting you for ages, but you need have
no fear if you will only follow my advice. As soon as you come into the
presence of my father, throw yourself at once on the ground and approach
him on your knees. Don't mind if he stamps furiously with his feet and
curses and swears. I'll attend to the rest, and in the meantime we had
better be off.'

With these words the beautiful Hyacinthia stamped on the ground with her
little foot, and the earth opened and they both sank down into the lower
world.",238,curse,is the antonym of,bless,What is the opposite of curse?,Bless.
king-kojata,7,"The palace of the Magician was all hewn out of a single carbuncle,
lighting up the whole surrounding region, and Prince Milan walked into
it gaily.

The Magician sat on a throne, a sparkling crown on his head; his eyes
blazed like a green fire, and instead of hands he had claws. As soon as
Prince Milan entered he flung himself on his knees. The Magician stamped
loudly with his feet, glared frightfully out of his green eyes, and
cursed so loudly that the whole underworld shook. But the Prince,
mindful of the counsel he had been given, wasn't the least afraid, and
approached the throne still on his knees. At last the Magician laughed
aloud and said, 'You rogue, you have been well advised to make me laugh;
I won't be your enemy any more. Welcome to the underworld! All the same,
for your delay in coming here, we must demand three services from you.
For to-day you may go, but to-morrow I shall have something more to say
to you.'

Then two servants led Prince Milan to a beautiful apartment, and he lay
down fearlessly on the soft bed that had been prepared for him, and was
soon fast asleep.

Early the next morning the Magician sent for him, and said, 'Let's see
now what you've learnt. In the first place you must build me a palace
to-night, the roof of purest gold, the walls of marble, and the
windows of crystal; all round you must lay out a beautiful garden, with
fish-ponds and artistic waterfalls. If you do all this, I will reward
you richly; but if you don't, you shall lose your head.'",80,glare,is a,stare,What does it mean to glare?,To glear means to stare at something.
king-kojata,8,"'Oh, you wicked monster!' thought Prince Milan, 'you might as well have
put me to death at once.' Sadly he returned to his room, and with bent
head sat brooding over his cruel fate till evening. When it grew dark, a
little bee flew by, and knocking at the window, it said, 'Open, and let
me in.'

Milan opened the window quickly, and as soon as the bee had entered, it
changed into the beautiful Hyacinthia.

'Good evening, Prince Milan. Why are you so sad?'

'How can I help being sad? Your father threatens me with death, and I
see myself already without a head.'

'And what have you made up your mind to do?'

'There's nothing to be done, and after all I suppose one can only die
once.'",83,bee,is at location of,field_of_flowers,Where can we find bees?,We can find bees in fields of flowers.
king-kojata,9,"'Now, don't be so foolish, my dear Prince; but keep up your spirits, for
there is no need to despair. Go to bed, and when you wake up to-morrow
morning the palace will be finished. Then you must go all round it,
giving a tap here and there on the walls to look as if you had just
finished it.'

And so it all turned out just as she had said. As soon as it was
daylight Prince Milan stepped out of his room, and found a palace which
was quite a work of art down to the very smallest detail. The Magician
himself was not a little astonished at its beauty, and could hardly
believe his eyes.

'Well, you certainly are a splendid workman,' he said to the Prince.
'I see you are very clever with your hands, now I must see if you are
equally accomplished with your head. I have thirty daughters in my
house, all beautiful princesses. To-morrow I will place the whole thirty
in a row. You must walk past them three times, and the third time you
must show me which is my youngest daughter Hyacinthia. If you don't
guess rightly, you shall lose your head.'",24,despair,is the antonym of,hope,What is the opposite of despair?,Hope.
king-kojata,10,"'This time you've made a mistake,' thought Prince Milan, and going to
his room he sat down at the window. 'Just fancy my not recognising the
beautiful Hyacinthia! Why, that is the easiest thing in the world.'

'Not so easy as you think,' cried the little bee, who was flying past.
'If I weren't to help you, you'd never guess. We are thirty sisters so
exactly alike that our own father can hardly distinguish us apart.'

'Then what am I to do?' asked Prince Milan.

'Listen,' answered Hyacinthia. 'You will recognise me by a tiny fly I
shall have on my left cheek, but be careful for you might easily make a
mistake.'",26,fancy,is the antonym of,simple,What is the opposite of fancy?,Simple.
king-kojata,11,"The next day the Magician again commanded Prince Milan to be led before
him. His daughters were all arranged in a straight row in front of him,
dressed exactly alike, and with their eyes bent on the ground.

'Now, you genius,' said the Magician, 'look at these beauties three
times, and then tell us which is the Princess Hyacinthia.'

Prince Milan went past them and looked at them closely. But they were
all so precisely alike that they looked like one face reflected in
thirty mirrors, and the fly was nowhere to be seen; the second time
he passed them he still saw nothing; but the third time he perceived a
little fly stealing down one cheek, causing it to blush a faint pink.
Then the Prince seized the girl's hand and cried out, 'This is the
Princess Hyacinthia!'

'You're right again,' said the Magician in amazement; 'but I've still
another task for you to do. Before this candle, which I shall light,
burns to the socket, you must have made me a pair of boots reaching to
my knees. If they aren't finished in that time, off comes your head.'",19,arrange,has subevent,organize,What does it mean to arrange?,To arrange means to organize.
king-kojata,12,"The Prince returned to his room in despair; then the Princess Hyacinthia
came to him once more changed into the likeness of a bee, and asked him,
'Why so sad, Prince Milan?'

'How can I help being sad? Your father has set me this time an
impossible task. Before a candle which he has lit burns to the socket,
I am to make a pair of boots. But what does a prince know of shoemaking?
If I can't do it, I lose my head.'

'And what do you mean to do?' asked Hyacinthia.

'Well, what is there to be done? What he demands I can't and won't do,
so he must just make an end of me.'

'Not so, dearest. I love you dearly, and you shall marry me, and I'll
either save your life or die with you. We must fly now as quickly as we
can, for there is no other way of escape.'

With these words she breathed on the window, and her breath froze on the
pane. Then she led Milan out of the room with her, shut the door, and
threw the key away. Hand in hand, they hurried to the spot where they
had descended into the lower world, and at last reached the banks of the
lake. Prince Milan's charger was still grazing on the grass which grew
near the water. The horse no sooner recognized his master, than it
neighed loudly with joy, and springing towards him, it stood as if
rooted to the ground, while Prince Milan and Hyacinthia jumped on its
back. Then it sped onwards like an arrow from a bow.",281,neigh,is a,cry,What is a neigh?,A neigh is the cry of a horse.
king-kojata,13,"In the meantime the Magician was waiting impatiently for the Prince.
Enraged by the delay, he sent his servants to fetch him, for the
appointed time was past.

The servants came to the door, and finding it locked, they knocked; but
the frozen breath on the window replied in Prince Milan's voice, 'I am
coming directly.' With this answer they returned to the Magician. But
when the Prince still did not appear, after a time he sent his servants
a second time to bring him. The frozen breath always gave the same
answer, but the Prince never came. At last the Magician lost all
patience, and commanded the door to be burst open. But when his servants
did so, they found the room empty, and the frozen breath laughed
aloud. Out of his mind with rage, the Magician ordered the Prince to be
pursued.",157,rage,is a,anger,What is rage?,Rage is violent and uncontrolled anger.
king-kojata,14,"Then a wild chase began. 'I hear horses' hoofs behind us,' said
Hyacinthia to the Prince. Milan sprang from the saddle, put his ear to
the ground and listened. 'Yes,' he answered, 'they are pursuing us, and
are quite close.' 'Then no time must be lost,' said Hyacinthia, and
she immediately turned herself into a river, Prince Milan into an iron
bridge, and the charger into a blackbird. Behind the bridge the road
branched off into three ways.

The Magician's servants hurried after the fresh tracks, but when they
came to the bridge, they stood, not knowing which road to take, as the
footprints stopped suddenly, and there were three paths for them to
choose from. In fear and trembling they returned to tell the Magician
what had happened. He flew into a dreadful rage when he saw them, and
screamed out, 'Oh, you fools! the river and bridge were they! Go back
and bring them to me at once, or it will be the worse for you.'",129,footprint,is a,trace,What are footprints?,Footprints are traces of feet left on sand or snow.
king-kojata,15,"Then the pursuit began afresh. 'I hear horses' hoofs,' sighed
Hyacinthia. The Prince dismounted and put his ear to the ground. 'They
are hurrying after us, and are already quite near.' In a moment the
Princess Hyacinthia had changed herself, the Prince, and his charger
into a thick wood where a thousand paths and roads crossed each other.
Their pursuers entered the forest, but searched in vain for Prince Milan
and his bride. At last they found themselves back at the same spot they
had started from, and in despair they returned once more with empty
hands to the Magician.

'Then I'll go after the wretches myself,' he shouted. 'Bring a horse at
once; they shan't escape me.'

Once more the beautiful Hyacinthia murmured, 'I hear horses' hoofs quite
near.' And the Prince answered, 'They are pursuing us hotly and are
quite close.'

'We are lost now, for that is my father himself. But at the first church
we come to his power ceases; he may chase us no further. Hand me your
cross.'

Prince Milan loosened from his neck the little gold cross his mother had
given him, and as soon as Hyacinthia grasped it, she had changed herself
into a church, Milan into a monk, and the horse into a belfry. They had
hardly done this when the magician and his servants rode up.

'Did you see no one pass by on horseback, reverend father?' he asked the
monk.

'Prince Milan and Princess Hyacinthia have just gone on this minute;
they stopped for a few minutes in the church to say their prayers, and
bade me light this wax candle for you, and give you their love.'",148,murmur,has subevent,talk,What does it mean to murmur?,To murmur means to talk in low and indistinct sound.
king-kojata,16,"'I'd like to wring their necks,' said the magician, and made all haste
home, where he had every one of his servants beaten to within an inch of
their lives.

Prince Milan rode on slowly with his bride without fearing any further
pursuit. The sun was just setting, and its last rays lit up a large city
they were approaching. Prince Milan was suddenly seized with an ardent
desire to enter the town.

'Oh my beloved,' implored Hyacinthia, 'please don't go; for I am
frightened and fear some evil.'

'What are you afraid of?' asked the Prince. 'We'll only go and look at
what's to be seen in the town for about an hour, and then we'll continue
our journey to my father's kingdom.'",68,approach,has subevent,advance,What does it mean to approach?,To approach means to advance nearer.
king-kojata,17,"'The town is easy to get into, but more difficult to get out of,' sighed
Hyacinthia. 'But let it be as you wish. Go, and I will await you here,
but I will first change myself into a white milestone; only I pray you
be very careful. The King and Queen of the town will come out to meet
you, leading a little child with them. Whatever you do, don't kiss the
child, or you will forget me and all that has happened to us. I will
wait for you here for three days.'

The Prince hurried to the town, but Hyacinthia remained behind disguised
as a white milestone on the road. The first day passed, and then the
second, and at last the third also, but Prince Milan did not return,
for he had not taken Hyacinthia's advice. The King and Queen came out to
meet him as she had said, leading with them a lovely fair-haired little
girl, whose eyes shone like two clear stars. The child at once caressed
the Prince, who, carried away by its beauty, bent down and kissed it on
the cheek. From that moment his memory became a blank, and he forgot all
about the beautiful Hyacinthia.",126,milestone,is a,marker,What is a milestone?,A milestone is a marker scattered along the road to show distance.
king-kojata,18,"When the Prince did not return, poor Hyacinthia wept bitterly and
changing herself from a milestone into a little blue field flower, she
said, 'I will grow here on the wayside till some passer-by tramples me
under foot.' And one of her tears remained as a dewdrop and sparkled on
the little blue flower.

Now it happened shortly after this that an old man passed by, and seeing
the flower, he was delighted with its beauty. He pulled it up carefully
by the roots and carried it home. Here he planted it in a pot, and
watered and tended the little plant carefully. And now the most
extraordinary thing happened, for from this moment everything in the old
man's house was changed. When he awoke in the morning he always found
his room tidied and put into such beautiful order that not a speck of
dust was to be found anywhere. When he came home at midday, he found a
table laid out with the most dainty food, and he had only to sit down
and enjoy himself to his heart's content. At first he was so surprised
he didn't know what to think, but after a time he grew a little
uncomfortable, and went to an old witch to ask for advice.

The witch said, 'Get up before the cock crows, and watch carefully till
you see something move, and then throw this cloth quickly over it, and
you'll see what will happen.'",52,dewdrop,is a,drop,What is a dewdrop?,A dewdrop is a drop of water that looks like a tiny sphere.
king-kojata,19,"All night the old man never closed an eye. When the first ray of light
entered the room, he noticed that the little blue flower began to
tremble, and at last it rose out of the pot and flew about the room,
put everything in order, swept away the dust, and lit the fire. In great
haste the old man sprang from his bed, and covered the flower with
the cloth the old witch had given him, and in a moment the beautiful
Princess Hyacinthia stood before him.

'What have you done?' she cried. 'Why have you called me back to life?
For I have no desire to live since my bridegroom, the beautiful Prince
Milan, has deserted me.'

'Prince Milan is just going to be married,' replied the old man.
'Everything is being got ready for the feast, and all the invited guests
are flocking to the palace from all sides.'

The beautiful Hyacinthia cried bitterly when she heard this; then she
dried her tears, and went into the town dressed as a peasant woman. She
went straight to the King's kitchen, where the white-aproned cooks were
running about in great confusion. The Princess went up to the head cook,
and said, 'Dear cook, please listen to my request, and let me make a
wedding-cake for Prince Milan.'

The busy cook was just going to refuse her demand and order her out of
the kitchen, but the words died on his lips when he turned and beheld
the beautiful Hyacinthia, and he answered politely, 'You have just come
in the nick of time, fair maiden. Bake your cake, and I myself will lay
it before Prince Milan.'",200,peasant,is at location of,village,Where do peasants live?,Peasants usually live in villages.
king-kojata,20,"The cake was soon made. The invited guests were already thronging round
the table, when the head cook entered the room, bearing a beautiful
wedding cake on a silver dish, and laid it before Prince Milan. The
guests were all lost in admiration, for the cake was quite a work of
art. Prince Milan at once proceeded to cut it open, when to his surprise
two white doves sprang out of it, and one of them said to the other: 'My
dear mate, do not fly away and leave me, and forget me as Prince Milan
forgot his beloved Hyacinthia.'

Milan sighed deeply when he heard what the little dove said. Then he
jumped up suddenly from the table and ran to the door, where he found
the beautiful Hyacinthia waiting for him. Outside stood his faithful
charger, pawing the ground. Without pausing for a moment, Milan and
Hyacinthia mounted him and galloped as fast as they could into the
country of King Kojata. The King and Queen received them with such
joy and gladness as had never been heard of before, and they all lived
happily for the rest of their lives.",75,dove,is a,pigeon,What is a dove?,A dove is a relatively small pigeon.

""Surely,"" said I, ""the Churches were not in King O'Toole's time?""

""Oh, by no means, your honor--truth, it's yourself that's right enough

the King owned the Churches--and why not, sir, seein' it was his
birthright, time out o' mind, beyond the flood? Well, the King (you see)

his life, and huntin' in particular. From the risin' o' the sun up
he got, and away he went over the mountains beyond after the deer: and

was all mighty good as long as the King had his health. But, you see, in

limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart failed him. He
was lost entirely for want o' diversions, because he couldn't go a huntin'
no longer. By dad, the poor King was obliged at last for to get a
goose to distract him. You see, the goose used for to swim across the
lake, and go down divin' for trout (and not finer trout in all Ireland
than the same trout) and catch fish on a Friday for the King. If flew
every other day round about the lake disctracting the poor King that you'd
think he'd break his sides laughin' at the frolicksome tricks of his
goose. So, in course o' time, the goose was the greatest pet in the
country, and the biggest rogue, and distracted the King to no end.

was. All went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken
in years, as well as the King, and grew stiff in the limbs, like her
master, and couldn't distract him no longer. Then it was that the
poor King was lost completely, and didn't know what in the wide world to
do. He was gone out of all distractions because the goose was
no more in the flower of her blume.

the foot o' the King, as fresh as a daisy, after flyin' round his
dominions, just as if she hadn't flew three perch.'

'Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the King standin' with
his mouth open, lookin' at his poor old goose flyin' as light as a
lark, and better nor ever she was. When she let at his foot he
patted her an the head, and ma vourneen,' says he, 'but you are the

say that word, the devil recieve the bit o' your goose id ever fly
again,' says Saint Kavin.

'Oh, you needn't laugh,' said old Joe, 'for it's truth I'm telling
you.'

Well, when the King was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was pleased
with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the King.

""Well, my dear, that's the way that the place came, all at once, into
the hands of Saint Kavin. The goose flew round every individual
acre o' King O'Toole's property, you see, bein' let into the secret
by Saint Kavin, who was mighty cute. So, when he done the old
King out of his property for the glory of God, he was pleased with him.
He and the King was the best o' friends ever more after (for the
poor old King was doatin' , you see), and the King had his goose as
good as new to distract him as long as he lived. The saint supported
him after he came into his property, as I told you, until the day of
his death--and that was soon afther. The poor goose thought he was
catchin' a trout one Friday. But, my jewel, it was a mistake he
made--and instead of a throut, it was a thievin' horse-eel! and, by gor,
instead of the goose killin' a trout for the King's supper--by dad, the
eel killed the King's goose--and small blame to him. But he didn't ate

Yet time passed slowly because she was so much alone, and she often thought of visiting her sisters and seeing how they were.

Now she was much frightened; for what else could she think but that the lion would tear her to pieces? But the beast was so weighed down with heavy iron chains that he could scarcely drag himself along, and the chains clashed at either side when he moved.

And then a wondrous thing took place: at the very moment the last chain fell from him, the lion turned into a handsome young prince, and when the princess looked at him more closely, it was none other than her heart's dearest, who before had been a dog.

lawn-dyarrig,1,"There was a King in his own time in Erin, and he went hunting one day.
The King met a man whose head was out through his cap, whose elbows and
knees were out through his clothing, and whose toes were out through his
shoes.

The man went up to the King, gave him a blow on the face, and drove
three teeth from his mouth. The same blow put the King's head in the
dirt. When he rose from the earth, the King went back to his castle, and
lay down sick and sorrowful.

The King had three sons, and their names were Ur, Arthur, and Lawn
Dyarrig. The three were at school that day, and came home in the
evening. The father sighed when the sons were coming in.

""What is wrong with our father?"" asked the eldest.

""Your father is sick on his bed,"" said the mother.

The three sons went to their father and asked what was on him.

""A strong man that I met to-day gave me a blow in the face, put my head
in the dirt, and knocked three teeth from my mouth. What would you do to
him if you met him?"" asked the father of the eldest son.

""If I met that man,"" replied Ur, ""I would make four parts of him between
four horses.""

""You are my son,"" said the King. ""What would you do if you met him?""
asked he then as he turned to the second son.

On the following morning the three brothers rose with the dawn; the
order was given Lawn Dyarrig to leave the castle and make his own way
for himself. The other two brothers were going to travel the world to
know could they find the man who had injured their father. Lawn Dyarrig
lingered outside till he saw the two, and they going off by themselves.

""It is a strange thing,"" said he, ""for two men of high degree to go
travelling without a servant.""

""We need no one,"" said Ur.

""Company wouldn't harm us,"" said Arthur.

The two let Lawn Dyarrig go with them as a serving-boy, and set out to
find the man who had struck down their father. They spent all that day
walking, and came late to a house where one woman was living. She shook
hands with Ur and Arthur, and greeted them. Lawn Dyarrig she kissed and
welcomed; called him son of the King of Erin.

""It is a strange thing to shake hands with the elder, and kiss the
younger,"" said Ur.

next morning the old woman was up, and had food for the young men. When
the three had eaten, she spoke to Ur, and this is what she asked of him:
""What was it that drove you from home, and what brought you to this
place?""

""A champion met my father, and took three teeth from him and put his
head in the dirt. I am looking for that man, to find him alive or dead.""

""That was the Green Knight from Terrible Valley. He is the man who took
the three teeth from your father. I am three hundred years living in
this place, and there is not a year of the three hundred in which three
hundred heroes, fresh, young, and noble, have not passed on the way to
Terrible Valley, and never have I seen one coming back, and each of them
had the look of a man better than you. And now where are you going,
Arthur?""

passed this way. He wore a suit as good as was ever above ground. I had
a daughter sewing there in the open window. He came outside, put a
finger under her girdle, and took her with him. Her father followed
straightway to save her, but I have never seen daughter nor father from
that day to this. That man was the Green Knight of Terrible Valley. He
is better than all the men that could stand on a field a mile in length
and a mile in breadth. If you take my advice you'll turn back and go
home to your father.""

It is how she vexed Ur with this talk, and he made a vow to himself to go
on. When Ur did not agree to turn home, the woman said to Lawn Dyarrig,
""Go back to my chamber; you'll find in it the apparel of a hero.""

He went back, and there was not a bit of the apparel he did not go into
with a spring.

""You may be able to do something now,"" said the woman, when Lawn Dyarrig
came to the front. ""Go back to my chamber and search through all the old
swords. You will find one at the bottom. Take that.""

He found the old sword, and at the first shake that he gave he knocked
seven barrels of rust out of it; after the second shake it was as bright
as when made.",301,rust,is a,corrosion,What is rust?,Rust is the corrosion of iron.
lawn-dyarrig,5,"""You may be able to do well with that,"" said the woman. ""Go out, now, to
that stable abroad, and take the slim white steed that is in it. That
one will never stop nor halt in any place till he brings you to the
Eastern World. If you like, take these two men behind you; if not, let
them walk. But I think it is useless for you to have them at all with
you.""

Lawn Dyarrig went out to the stable, took the slim white steed, mounted,
rode to the front, and catching the two brothers, planted them on the
horse behind him.

""Now, Lawn Dyarrig,"" said the woman, ""this horse will never stop till he
stands on the little white meadow in the Eastern World. When he stops,
you'll come down, and cut the turf under his beautiful right front
foot.""

The horse started from the door, and at every leap he crossed seven
hills and valleys, seven castles with villages, acres, roods, and odd
perches. He could overtake the whirlwind before him seven hundred times
before the whirlwind behind him could overtake him once. Early in the
afternoon of the next day he was in the Eastern World. When he
dismounted, Lawn Dyarrig cut the sod from under the foot of the slim
white steed, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and
Terrible Valley was down under him there. What he did next was to
tighten the reins on the neck of the steed and let him go home.

""Now,"" said Lawn Dyarrig to his brothers, ""which would you rather be
doing--making a basket or twisting gads (withes)?""

""We would rather be making a basket; our help is among ourselves,""
answered they.",201,acre,is a,area_unit,What is acre?,Arce is an English unit of land area.

When Lawn Dyarrig came to the opening with the gads all twisted and made
into one, they hadn't the ribs of the basket in the ground yet.

""Oh, then, haven't ye anything done but that?""

""Stop your mouth,"" said Ur, ""or we'll make a mortar of your head on the
next stone.""

""To be kind to one another is the best for us,"" said Lawn Dyarrig. ""I'll
make the basket.""

While they'd be putting one rod in the basket he had the basket
finished.

""Oh, brother,"" said they, ""you are a quick workman.""

They had not called him brother since they left home till that moment.

""Who will go in the basket now?"" said Lawn Dyarrig when it was finished
and the gad tied to it.

""Who but me?"" said Ur. ""I am sure, brothers, if I see anything to
frighten me you'll draw me up.""

""We will,"" said the other two.

He went in, but had not gone far when he cried to pull him up again.

""By my father, and the tooth of my father, and by all that is in Erin,
dead or alive, I would not give one other sight on Terrible Valley!"" he
cried, when he stepped out of the basket.",139,workman,is a,worker,What is a workman?,A workman is a worker who labours for wages.

at Terrible Valley for all that's in Erin, dead or alive!""

""I will go now,"" said Lawn Dyarrig, ""and as I put no foul play on you, I
hope ye'll not put foul play on me.""

""We will not, indeed,"" said they.

Whatever length the other two went, Lawn Dyarrig didn't go the half of
it, till he stepped out of the basket and went down on his own feet. It
was not far he had travelled in Terrible Valley when he met seven
hundred heroes guarding the country.

""In what place here has the Green King his castle?"" asked he of the
seven hundred.

""What sort of a sprisawn goat or sheep from Erin are you?"" asked they.

""If we had a hold of you, the two arms of me, that's a question you
would not put a second time; but if we haven't you, we'll not be so
long.""

They faced Lawn Dyarrig then and attacked him; but he went through them
like a hawk or a raven through small birds. He made a heap of their
feet, a heap of their heads, and a castle of their arms.",161,hero,is a,human,What is a hero?,A hero is a human being who carries our noble deeds.
lawn-dyarrig,8,"After that he went his way walking, and had not gone far when he came to
a spring. ""I'll have a drink before I go further,"" thought he. With that
he stooped down and took a drink of the water. When he had drunk he lay
on the ground and fell asleep.

Now, there wasn't a morning that the lady in the Green Knight's castle
didn't wash in the water of that spring, and she sent a maid for the
water each time. Whatever part of the day it was when Lawn Dyarrig fell
asleep, he was sleeping in the morning when the girl came. She thought
it was dead the man was, and she was so in dread of him that she would
not come near the spring for a long time. At last she saw he was asleep,
and then she took the water. Her mistress was complaining of her for
being so long.

""Do not blame me,"" said the maid. ""I am sure that if it was yourself
that was in my place you'd not come back so soon.""

""How so?"" asked the lady.

""The finest hero that ever a woman laid eyes on is sleeping at the
spring.""

""That's a thing that cannot be till Lawn Dyarrig comes to the age of a
hero. When that time comes he'll be sleeping at the spring.""

""He is in it now,"" said the girl.",67,morning,is part of,day,What is morning?,Morning is the early part of the day.

quickly from the castle. When she came to the spring she roused Lawn
Dyarrig. If she found him lying, she left him standing. She smothered
him with kisses, drowned him with tears, dried him with garments of fine
silk and with her own hair. Herself and himself locked arms and walked
into the castle of the Green Knight. After that they were inviting each
other with the best food and entertainment till the middle of the
following day. Then the lady said:

""When the Green Knight bore me away from my father and mother he brought
me straight to this castle, but I put him under bonds not to marry me
for seven years and a day, and he cannot; still, I must serve him. When
he goes fowling he spends three days away and the next three days at
home. This is the day for him to come back, and for me to prepare his
dinner. There is no stir that you or I have made here to-day but that
brass head beyond there will tell of it.""",61,silk,is at location of,china,Where is silk originated?,Silk is originated from China.
lawn-dyarrig,10,"""It is equal to you what it tells,"" said Lawn Dyarrig, ""only make ready
a clean long chamber for me.""

She did so, and he went back into it. Herself rose up then to prepare
dinner for the Green Knight. When he came, she welcomed him as every
day. She left down his food before him, and he sat to take his dinner.
He was sitting with knife and fork in hand when the brass head spoke.
""I thought when I saw you taking food and drink with your wife that you
had the blood of a man in you. If you could see that sprisawn of a goat
or sheep out of Erin taking meat and drink with her all day, what would
you do?""",110,blood,is part of,body,What is blood?,Blood is a vital liquid flowing in the bodies.
lawn-dyarrig,11,"""Oh, my suffering and sorrow!"" cried the knight. ""I'll never take
another bite or sup till I eat some of his liver and heart. Let three
hundred heroes, fresh and young, go back and bring his heart to me, with
the liver and lights, till I eat them.""

The three hundred heroes went, and hardly were they behind in the
chamber when Lawn Dyarrig had them all dead in one heap.

""He must have some exercise to delay my men, they are so long away,""
said the knight. ""Let three hundred more heroes go for his heart, with
the liver and lights, and bring them here to me.""

The second three hundred went, and as they were entering the chamber
Lawn Dyarrig was making a heap of them, till the last one was inside,
where there were two heaps.",28,liver,is a,organ_in_body,What is a liver?,A liver is a large organ in the body.
lawn-dyarrig,12,"""He has some way of coaxing my men to delay,"" said the knight. ""Do you
go now, three hundred of my savage hirelings, and bring him."" The three
hundred savage hirelings went, and Lawn Dyarrig let every man of them
enter before he raised a hand, then he caught the bulkiest of them all
by the two ankles, and began to wallop the others with him, and he
walloped them till he drove the life out of the two hundred and
ninety-nine. The bulkiest one was worn to the shin-bones that Lawn
Dyarrig held in his two hands. The Green Knight, who thought Lawn
Dyarrig was coaxing the men, called out then, ""Come down, my men, and
take dinner.""

""I'll be with you,"" said Lawn Dyarrig, ""and have the best food in the
house, and I'll have the best bed in the house. God not be good to you
for it, either.""",39,hireling,is a,employee,What is a hireling?,A hireling is an employee hired to perform unpleasant tasks.
lawn-dyarrig,13,"He went down to the Green Knight, and took the food from before him and
put it before himself. Then he took the lady, set her on his own knee,
and he and she went on eating. After dinner he put his finger under her
girdle, took her to the best chamber in the castle, and stood on guard
upon it till morning. Before dawn the lady said to Lawn Dyarrig:

""If the Green Knight strikes the pole of combat first, he'll win the
day; if you strike first, you'll win if you do what I tell you. The
Green Knight has so much enchantment that if he sees it is going against
him the battle is, he'll rise like a fog in the air, come down in the
same form, strike you, and make a green stone of you. When yourself and
himself are going out to fight in the morning, cut a sod a perch long,
in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; you'll leave the sod on
the next little hillock you meet. When the Green Knight is coming down
and is ready to strike, give him a blow with the sod. You'll make a
green stone of him.""",89,combat,is a,battle,What is a combat?,A combate is a battle or a fight.
lawn-dyarrig,14,"As early as the dawn Lawn Dyarrig rose and struck the pole of combat.
The blow that he gave did not leave calf, foal, lamb, kid, or child
waiting for birth, without turning them five times to the left and five
times to the right.

""What do you want?"" asked the knight.

""All that's in your kingdom to be against me the first quarter of the
day, and yourself the second quarter.""

""You have not left in the kingdom now but myself, and it is early enough
for you that I'll be at you.""",25,foal,is part of,horse,What is a foal?,A foal is a young horse.
lawn-dyarrig,15,"The knight faced him, and they went at each other, and fought till late
in the day. The battle was strong against Lawn Dyarrig, when the lady
stood in the door of the castle.

""Increase on your blows and increase on your courage,"" cried she. ""There
is no woman here but myself to wail over you, or to stretch you before
burial.""

When the knight heard the voice he rose in the air like a lump of fog.
As he was coming down Lawn Dyarrig struck him with the sod on the right
side of his breast, and made a green stone of him.

The lady rushed out then, and whatever welcome she had for Lawn Dyarrig
the first time, she had twice as much now. Herself and himself went into
the castle, and spent that night very comfortably. In the morning they
rose early, and collected all the gold, utensils, and treasures. Lawn
Dyarrig found the three teeth of his father in a pocket of the Green
Knight, and took them. He and the lady brought all the riches to where
the basket was. ""If I send up this beautiful lady,"" thought Lawn
Dyarrig, ""she may be taken from me by my brothers; if I remain below
with her, she may be taken from me by people here."" He put her in the
basket, and she gave him a ring so that they might know each other if
they met. He shook the gad, and she rose in the basket.

When Ur saw the basket, he thought, ""What's above let it be above, and
what's below let it stay where it is.""",63,wail,has subevent,cry,What does it mean to wail?,To wail means to cry out in sorrow or anguish.
lawn-dyarrig,16,"""I'll have you as wife for ever for myself,"" said he to the lady.

""I put you under bonds,"" says she, ""not to lay a hand on me for a day
and three years.""

""That itself would not be long even if twice the time,"" said Ur.

The two brothers started home with the lady; on the way Ur found the
head of an old horse with teeth in it, and took them, saying, ""These
will be my father's three teeth.""

They travelled on, and reached home at last. Ur would not have left a
tooth in his father's mouth, trying to put in the three that he had
brought; but the father stopped him.

Lawn Dyarrig, left in Terrible Valley, began to walk around for himself.
He had been walking but one day when whom should he meet but the lad
Short-clothes, and he saluted him. ""By what way can I leave Terrible
Valley?"" asked Lawn Dyarrig.",179,salute,has subevent,greet,What does it mean to salute?,"To salute means to greet in a formal, non-verbal gesture."
lawn-dyarrig,17,"""If I had a grip on you that's what you wouldn't ask me a second time,""

""If you haven't touched me, you will before you are much older.""

""If you do, you will not treat me as you did all my people and my
master.""

""I'll do worse to you than I did to them,"" said Lawn Dyarrig.

They caught each other then, one grip under the arm and one on the
shoulder. It is not long they were wrestling when Lawn Dyarrig had
Short-clothes on the earth, and he gave him the five thin tyings dear
and tight.

""You are the best hero I have ever met,"" said Short-clothes; ""give me
quarter for my soul--spare me. When I did not tell you of my own will, I
must tell in spite of myself.""

""It is as easy for me to loosen you as to tie you,"" said Lawn Dyarrig,
and he freed him.",179,loosen,is the antonym of,tighten,What is the opposite of loosen?,Tighten.
lawn-dyarrig,18,"""Since you are not dead now,"" said Short-clothes, ""there is no death
allotted to you. I'll find a way for you to leave Terrible Valley. Go
and take that old bridle hanging there beyond and shake it; whatever
beast comes and puts its head into the bridle will carry you.""

Lawn Dyarrig shook the bridle, and a dirty, shaggy little foal came and
put its head in the bridle. Lawn Dyarrig mounted, dropped the reins on
the foal's neck, and let him take his own choice of roads. The foal
brought Lawn Dyarrig out by another way to the upper world, and took him
to Erin. Lawn Dyarrig stopped some distance from his father's castle,
and knocked at the house of an old weaver.

""Who are you?"" asked the old man.

""I am a weaver,"" said Lawn Dyarrig.

""What can you do?""

""I can spin for twelve and twist for twelve.""

""This is a very good man,"" said the old weaver to his sons, ""let us try
him.""

The work they had been doing for a year he had done in one hour. When
dinner was over the old man began to wash and shave, and his two sons
began to do the same.

""Why is this?"" asked Lawn Dyarrig.

""Haven't you heard that Ur, son of the King, is to marry to-night the
woman that he took from the Green Knight of Terrible Valley?""

""I have not,"" said Lawn Dyarrig; ""as all are going to the wedding, I
suppose I may go without offence?""

""Oh, you may,"" said the weaver; ""there will be a hundred thousand
welcomes before you.""",239,shave,causes,bald,What does it mean to shave?,To shave means to make skin bald or hair shorter.
lawn-dyarrig,19,"""Are there any linen sheets within?""

""There are,"" said the weaver.

""It is well to have bags ready for yourself and two sons.""

The weaver made bags for the three very quickly. They went to the
wedding. Lawn Dyarrig put what dinner was on the first table into the
weaver's bag, and sent the old man home with it. The food of the second
table he put in the eldest son's bag, filled the second son's bag from
the third table, and sent the two home.

The complaint went to Ur that an impudent stranger was taking all the
food.

""It is not right to turn any man away,"" said the bridegroom, ""but if
that stranger does not mind he will be thrown out of the castle.""

""Let me look at the face of the disturber,"" said the bride.

""Go and bring the fellow who is troubling the guests,"" said Ur to the
servants.

Lawn Dyarrig was brought right away, and stood before the bride, who
filled a glass with wine and gave it to him. Lawn Dyarrig drank half the
wine, and dropped in the ring which the lady had given him in Terrible
Valley.

When the bride took the glass again the ring went of itself with one
leap on to her finger. She knew then who was standing before her.",226,ring,is a,piece_of_jewelry,What is a ring?,A ring is a piece of jewelry.
lawn-dyarrig,20,"""This is the man who conquered the Green Knight and saved me from
Terrible Valley,"" said she to the King of Erin; ""this is Lawn Dyarrig,
your son.""

Lawn Dyarrig took out the three teeth and put them in his father's
mouth. They fitted there perfectly, and grew into their old place. The
King was satisfied, and as the lady would marry no man but Lawn Dyarrig,
he was the bridegroom.

""I must give you a present,"" said the bride to the Queen. ""Here is a
beautiful scarf which you are to wear as a girdle this evening.""

The Queen put the scarf round her waist.

""Tell me now,"" said the bride to the Queen, ""who was Ur's father.""

""What father could he have but his own father, the King of Erin?""

""Tighten, scarf,"" said the bride.

That moment the Queen thought that her head was in the sky and the lower
half of her body down deep in the earth.

""Oh, my grief and my woe!"" cried the Queen.

""Answer my question in truth, and the scarf will stop squeezing you. Who
was Ur's father?""

""The gardener,"" said the Queen.",126,waist,is a,body_part,What is a waist?,A waist is the body part between the pelvis and the stomach.

If the Queen suffered before, she suffered twice as much this time, and
screamed for help.

""Answer me truly, and you'll be without pain; if not, death will be on
you this minute. Whose son is Arthur?""

""The swineherd's.""

""Who is the King's son?""

""The King has no son but Lawn Dyarrig.""

""Tighten, scarf.""

The scarf did not tighten, and if the Queen had been commanding it a day
and a year it would not have tightened, for the Queen told the truth
that time. When the wedding was over, the King gave Lawn Dyarrig half
his kingdom, and made Ur and Arthur his servants.",74,swineherd,is a,herder,What is a swineherd?,A swineherd is a herder or keeper of pigs.

shore near the base of the lofty highlands, called Kaug Wudjoo.

From her earliest youth she was observed to be thoughtful and retiring.
She passed much of her time in solitude, and seemed ever to prefer the
companionship of her own shadow to the society of the lodge-circle.

Whenever she could leave her father's lodge she would fly to remote
haunts and recesses in the woods, or sit in lonely reverie upon some
high promontory of rock overlooking the lake. In such places she would
often, with her face turned upward, linger long in contemplation of the

were not able to restrain them, for she was of so gentle and delicate a
temper that they feared to thwart her.

wished to solicit her spirits to procure pleasant dreams, or any other

passed by her as little trivial pageants in which she had no concern.

through the field, and the whole circle was set in a roar.

Laughter rung merrily through the corn-field, but Leelinau, casting down
upon the ground the crooked ear of maize, walked pensively away.

Thither she now repaired, and, while reclining pensively against the
young pine-tree, she fancied that she heard a voice addressing her. At
first it was scarcely more than a sigh; presently it grew more clear,

although it chanced that a company of fishermen, who were spearing fish
near the Spirit Grove, descried something that seemed to resemble a
female figure standing on the shore. As the evening was mild and the
waters calm, they cautiously pulled their canoe toward land, but the
slight ripple of their oars excited alarm. The figure fled in haste, but
they could recognize in the shape and dress as she ascended the bank,
the lost daughter, and they saw the green plumes of her fairy-lover
waving over his forehead as he glided lightly through the forest of
young pines.",100,spear,has subevent,stick_out,What detail does spear have?,Stick out.
little-lasse,1,"There was once a little boy whose name was Lars, and because he was so
little he was called Little Lasse; he was a brave little man, for he
sailed round the world in a pea-shell boat.

It was summer time, when the pea shells grew long and green in the
garden. Little Lasse crept into the pea bed where the pea stalks rose
high above his cap, and he picked seventeen large shells, the longest
and straightest he could find.

Little Lasse thought, perhaps, that no one saw him; but that was
foolish, for God sees everywhere.

Then the gardener came with his gun over his shoulder, and he heard
something rustling in the pea bed.

'I think that must be a sparrow,' he said. 'Ras! Ras!' but no sparrows
flew out, for Little Lasse had no wings, only two small legs. 'Wait! I
will load my gun and shoot the sparrows,' said the gardener.

Then Little Lasse was frightened, and crept out on to the path.

'Forgive me, dear gardener!' he said. 'I wanted to get some fine boats.'

Lasse must ask leave to go and look for boats in the pea bed.'",49,shell,is at location of,ocean,Where's shell?,At the location of ocean.

little-lasse,2,"'I will,' answered Lasse; and he went off to the shore. Then he opened
the shells with a pin, split them carefully in two, and broke small
little bits of sticks for the rowers' seats. Then he took the peas which
were in the shells and put them in the boats for cargo. Some of the
shells got broken, some remained whole, and when all were ready Lasse
had twelve boats. But they should not be boats, they should be large
warships. He had three liners, three frigates, three brigs and three
schooners. The largest liner was called Hercules, and the smallest
schooner The Flea. Little Lasse put all the twelve into the water, and
they floated as splendidly and as proudly as any great ships over the
waves of the ocean.

And now the ships must sail round the world. The great island over there
was Asia; that large stone Africa; the little island America; the small
stones were Polynesia; and the shore from which the ships sailed out was
Europe. The whole fleet set off and sailed far away to other parts of
the world. The ships of the line steered a straight course to Asia, the
frigates sailed to Africa, the brigs to America, and the schooners to
Polynesia. But Little Lasse remained in Europe, and threw small stones
out into the great sea.

little-lasse,3,"'I shall row out a little way--only a very little way,' he thought. The
pea-shell boats had travelled so far that they only looked like little
specks on the ocean. 'I shall seize Hercules on the coast of Asia,' said
Lasse, 'and then row home again to Europe.'

He shook the rope that held the boat, and, strange to say, the rope
became loose. Ditsch, ratsch, a man is a man, and so Little Lasse manned
the boat.

Now he would row--and he could row, for he had rowed so often on the
step sat home, when the steps pretended to be a boat and father's big
stick an oar. But when Little Lasse wanted to row there were no oars
to be found in the boat. The oars were locked up in the boat-house, and
Little Lasse had not noticed that the boat was empty. It is not so easy
as one thinks to row to Asia without oars.

What could Little Lasse do now? The boat was already some distance out
on the sea, and the wind, which blew from land, was driving it still
further out. Lasse was frightened and began to cry. But there was no
one on the shore to hear him. Only a big crow perched alone in the birch
tree; and the gardener's black cat sat under the birch tree, waiting to
catch the crow. Neither of them troubled themselves in the least about
Little Lasse, who was drifting out to sea.",40,seize,has subevent,hook,What does it mean to seize?,Hook.

into the boat, when father and mother had so often forbidden him to do

be lost out on the great sea. What should he do?

When he had shouted until he was tired and no one heard him, he put
his two little hands together and said, 'Good God, do not be angry with
Little Lasse.' And then he went to sleep. For although it was daylight,
old Nukku Matti was sitting on the shores of the 'Land of Nod,' and was
fishing for little children with his long fishing rod. He heard the low

Pacific Ocean. A long way off in the winter mist they could see the
explorer Nordenskiold with his ship Vega trying to find an opening
between the ice. It was so cold, so cold; the great icebergs glittered
strangely, and the huge whales now lived under the ice, for they could
not make a hole through with their awkward heads. All around on the
dreary shore there was snow and snow as far as the eye could see; little

'it is not far to America'--and at the same moment they were there.

The sun was shining and it was very warm. Tall palm trees grew in long
rows on the shore and bore coconuts in their top branches. Men red as
copper galloped over the immense green prairies and shot their arrows
at the buffaloes, who turned against them with their sharp horns. An
enormous cobra which had crept up the stem of a tall palm tree threw
itself on to a little llama that was grazing at the foot. Knaps! it was

little way to Polynesia'--and then they were there.

It was very warm there, as warm as in a hot bath in Finland. Costly
spices grew on the shores: the pepper plant, the cinnamon tree, ginger,
saffron; the coffee plant and the tea plant. Brown people with long ears
and thick lips, and hideously painted faces, hunted a yellow-spotted
tiger among the high bamboos on the shore, and the tiger turned on them

to flight.",24,buffalo,is a,cow,What's buffalo?,A kind of cow.

'We can do so,' said the dream-boy with the blue eyes. 'We are not far
from Africa'--and as he said that they were there.

They anchored at the mouth of a great river where the shores were
as green as the greenest velvet. A little distance from the river an
immense desert stretched away. The air was yellow; the sun shone so hot,
so hot as if it would burn the earth to ashes, and the people were as
black as the blackest jet. They rode across the desert on tall camels;
the lions roared with thirst, and the great crocodiles with their grey
lizard heads and sharp white teeth gaped up out of the river.",101,stretch,is a,extension,What's stretch?,Extension.

'We can travel back to Europe,' said the dream-boy with the fair hair.
And with that they were there.

They came to a shore where it was all so cool and familiar and friendly.
There stood the tall birch tree with its drooping leaves; at the top sat
the old crow, and at its foot crept the gardener's black cat. Not far
away was a house which Little Lasse had seen before; near the house
there was a garden, and in the garden a pea bed with long pea shells.
An old gardener with a green coat walked about and wondered if the
cucumbers were ripe. Fylax was barking on the steps, and when he saw
Little Lasse he wagged his tail. Old Stina was milking the cows in the
farmyard, and there was a very familiar lady in a check woollen shawl
on her way to the bleaching green to see if the clothes were bleached.
There was, too, a well-known gentleman in a yellow summer coat, with a
long pipe in his mouth; he was going to see if the reapers had cut the
rye. A boy and a girl were running on the shore and calling out, 'Little
Lasse! Come home for bread-and-butter!'

'Shall we land here?' asked the dream-boy, and he blinked his blue eyes
roguishly.

little-lasse,10,"'Wait a little,' said the dream-boy. And now Little Lasse saw that the
kitchen door was open, and from within there was heard a low, pleasant
frizzling, like that which is heard when one whisks yellow batter with a
wooden ladle into a hot frying-pan.

'Perhaps we should sail back to Polynesia now?' said the happy
dream-boy.

'No; they are frying pancakes in Europe just now,' said Little Lasse;
and he wanted to jump ashore, but he could not. The dream-boy had tied
him with a chain of flowers, so that he could not move. And now all
the little dreams came about him, thousands and thousands of little
children, and they made a ring around him and sang a little song:

          The world is very, very wide,
               Little Lasse, Lasse,
          And though you've sailed beyond the tide,
          You can never tell how wide
          It is on the other side,
               Lasse, Little Lasse.
          You have found it cold and hot,
               Little Lasse, Lasse;
          But in no land is God not,
               Lasse, Little Lasse.
          Many men live there as here,
          But they all to God are dear,

               Whene'er you roam,
               Do you not find the best is home

little-lasse,11,"When the dreams had sung their song they skipped away, and Nukku Matti
carried Lasse back to the boat. He lay there for a long time quite
still, and he still heard the frying-pan frizzling at home of the fire,
the frizzling was very plain, Little Lasse heard it quite near him; and
so he woke up and rubbed his eyes.

There he lay in the boat, where he had fallen asleep. The wind had
turned, and the boat had drifted out with one wind and drifted in with
another while Little Lasse slept, and what Lasse thought was frizzling
in a frying-pan was the low murmur of the waves as they washed against
the stones on the shore. But he was not altogether wrong, for the clear
blue sea is like a great pan in which God's sun all day makes cakes for
good children.

Little Lasse rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and looked around him.
Everything was the same as before; the crow in the birch tree, the cat
on the grass, and the pea-shell fleet on the shore. Some of the ships
had foundered, and some had drifted back to land. Hercules had come back
with its cargo from Asia, The Flea had arrived from Polynesia, and the
other parts of the world were just where they were before.

Little Lasse did not know what to think. He had so often been in that
grotto in the 'Land of Nod' and did not know what tricks dreams can
play. But Little Lasse did not trouble his head with such things; he
gathered together his boats and walked up the shore back to the house.",208,founder,has subevent,sink,What detail does founder have?,Sink.

strange frizzling.

The gardener was near the gate, watering the dill and parsley, the
carrots and parsnips.

'Well,' he said, 'where has Little Lasse been so long?'

Little Lasse straightened himself up stiff, and answered: 'I have sailed
round the world in a pea-shell boat.'

'Oh!' said the gardener.

There was an army of servants about the house, and many of them had no other duties than to wait upon Miss Muffet, for the little girl was an only child and therefore a personage of great importance.

""Well,"" replied the lady; ""you must have the doctor to see her; and don't forget to let me know what he says. That is all, Nurse.""

She turned to her novel again, and the Nurse walked away and sent a servant for the doctor. That great man, when he came, shook his head solemnly and said,

""She must have a change. Take her away into the country as soon as possible.""

""And very good advice it was, too,"" remarked the Nurse to one of the maids; ""for I feel as if I needed a change myself.""

The morning after their arrival the little girl asked to go out upon the lawn.

""Well,"" replied Nurse Holloweg, ""Sarah can take you out for half an hour. But remember you are not to run and get heated, for that will ruin your complexion; and you must not speak to any of the common children you meet, for your mother would object; and you must not get your shoes dusty nor your dress soiled, nor disobey Sarah in any way.""",140,disobey,has subevent,refuse,What is disobey?,Disobey is when one refuses to obey.

Indeed, a few minutes later, when Sarah had fallen asleep upon a bench under a big shade tree, Miss Muffet decided she would really run away for once in her life, and see how it seemed.

There was a pretty lane near by, running between shady trees far out into the country, and, stealing softly away from Sarah's side, the little girl ran as fast as she could go, and never stopped until she was all out of breath.

While she rested and wondered what she could do next, a farmer came along, driving an empty cart.",112,lane,is a,path,What is a lane?,A lane is a road or path.

So she ran and caught on the end of the cart, and actually climbed into it, falling all in a heap upon the straw that lay upon the bottom. But it didn't hurt her at all, and the next minute the farmer whipped up his horses, and they went trotting along the lane, carrying Miss Muffet farther and farther away from hated Nurse Holloweg and the dreadful maids.

She looked around upon the green fields and the waving grain, and drew in deep breaths of the fresh country air, and was happy for almost the first time in her little life. By and by she lay back upon the straw and fell asleep; and the farmer, who did not know she was in his cart, drove on for many miles, until at last he stopped at a small wooden farm-house, and jumped to the ground.",81,whip,has subevent,strike,What is whipping up a horse?,Whipping up a horse means striking a horse so that it will run faster.

""Yes,"" he replied, as he began to unharness the horses; ""they are in the cart.""

So she came to the cart and looked within, and saw Miss Muffet, who was still asleep.

""Where did you get the little girl?"" asked the farmer's wife, in surprise.

""What little girl?"" asked he.

""The one in the cart.""

He came to the cart and looked in, and was as surprised as his wife.",45,grocery,is at location of,supermarket,Where are groceries usually sold?,Groceries are usually sold in supermarkets.

So the farmer's wife shook the girl by the arm, and Miss Muffet sat up in the cart and rubbed her eyes and wondered where she was.

""How came you in my cart?"" asked the farmer.

""I caught on behind, and climbed in,"" answered the girl.

""What is your name, and where do you live?"" enquired the farmer's wife.

""My name is Miss Muffet, and I live in a big city,-but where, I do not know.""

And that was all she could tell them, so the woman said at last,

""We must keep her till some one comes to claim her, and she can earn her living by helping me make the cheeses.""

""That will be nice,"" said Miss Muffet, with a laugh, ""for Nurse Holloweg never lets me do anything, and I should like to help somebody do something.""",7,cart,is capable of,transport_things,What can we do with carts in a supermarkets?,We can transport goods with carts in a supermarket.
little-miss-muffet,11,"So they led her into the house, where the farmer's wife wondered at the fine texture of her dress and admired the golden chain that hung around her neck.

""Some one will surely come for her,"" the woman said to her husband, ""for she is richly dressed and must belong to a family of some importance.""

Nevertheless, when they had eaten dinner, for which Little Miss Muffet had a wonderful appetite, the woman took her into the dairy and told her how she could assist her in curdling the milk and preparing it for the cheese-press.

""Why, it's really fun to work,"" said the girl, at first, ""and I should like to live here always. I do hope Nurse Holloweg will not find me.""

After a time, however, she grew weary, and wanted to rest; but the woman had not yet finished her cheese-making, so she bade the girl keep at her tasks.

""It's time enough to rest when the work is done,"" she said, ""and if you stay with me you must earn your board. No one is allowed to idle in this house.""

So Little Miss Muffet, though she felt like crying and was very tired, kept at her work until at length all was finished and the last cheese was in the press.

""Now,"" said the farmer's wife, ""since you have worked so well I shall give you a dish of curds and whey for your supper, and you may go out into the orchard and eat it under the shade of the trees.""",22,admire,has subevent,respect,What is admire?,Admire is when you respect others.

She first looked around for a place to sit down, and finally discovered a little grassy mound, which is called a tuffet in the country, and seated herself upon it. Then she tasted the curds and whey and found them very good.

But while she was eating she chanced to look down at her feet, and there was a great black spider coming straight towards her. The girl had never seen such an enormous and hideous-looking spider before, and she was so frightened that she gave a scream and tipped backward off the tuffet, spilling the curds and whey all over her dress as she did so. This frightened her more than ever, and as soon as she could get upon her feet she scampered away to the farm-house as fast as she could go, crying bitterly as she ran.",34,orchard,is a,farmland,What is an orchard?,An orchard is a farmland.

This made the woman laugh, for she was not afraid of spiders.

Soon after they heard a sound of wheels upon the road and a handsome carriage came dashing up to the gate.

""Has anyone seen a little girl who has run away?"" asked Nurse Holloweg, leaning out of the carriage.

""Oh, yes,"" answered Little Miss Muffet; ""here I am, Nurse."" And she ran out and jumped into the carriage, for she was very glad to get back again to those who would care for her and not ask her to work making cheeses.",65,dash,is a,run,What is dash?,Dash is when one runs quickly and suddenly.

""You must promise me, Miss Muffet, never to run away again. You have frightened me nearly into hysterics, and had you been lost your mother would have been quite disappointed.""

The little girl was silent for a time; then she answered,

""I will promise not to run away if you will let me play as other children do. But if you do not allow me to run and romp and dig in the ground, I shall keep running away, no matter how many horrid spiders come to frighten me!""",93,dig,has subevent,hollow,What is dig?,Dig is when one hollows or makes a hole with a shovel on the ground.

She kept her word, too, and when Little Miss Muffet went back to her home in the city her cheeks were as red as roses and her eyes sparkled with health. And she grew, in time, to be a beautiful young lady, and as healthy and robust as she was beautiful. Seeing which, the doctor put an extra large fee in his bill for advising that the little girl be taken to the country; and Mr. Muffet paid it without a word of protest.

Even after Miss Muffet grew up and was married she never forgot the day that she ran away, nor the curds and whey she ate for her supper, nor the great spider that frightened her away from the tuffet.",156,spider,is at location of,basement,Where do we usually see spiders?,We usually see spiders in dusty basements.

to do but to travel to Copenhagen. This is what Blessom had done, and
what his son did after him, for he, too, carried on a law-suit. Now it
chanced that on Christmas Eve John had had speech with the gentleman in
authority, and had attended to his business, and was going along the
street in a low-spirited manner, for he was homesick. And as he went
along, a man from Vaage, in a white blouse, with a knapsack, and buttons

a roaring in the Jutulsberg, and the path before him suddenly grew so
bright that one could have picked a needle from the ground. And he
forgot what he had promised, and turned his head to see what was
happening. There stood the giant gate of the Jutulsberg wide open, and
out of it streamed a light and radiance as of thousands of candles. In

know how many there were, but the youngest was not content at home.
He insisted on going out into the world to seek his fortune. And in
the end the king had to give him permission to do so. After he had
wandered for a few days, he came to a giant's castle, and took service
with the giant. In the morning the giant wanted to go off to herd his
goats, and when he started he told the king's son he was to clean the
stable in the meantime. ""And when you are through with that, you need
do nothing more for to-day, for you might as well know that you have
come to a kind master,"" said he. ""But you must do what you are told to

look at the other room, there surely must be something in it that he is
alarmed about, since I am not so much as to take a look,"" thought he,
and went into the first room. There hung a kettle, and it was boiling,
but the king's son could find no fire beneath it. ""What can there be in
it?"" thought he, and dipped in a lock of his hair, and at once the hair
grew just like copper. ""That's a fine soup, and whoever tastes it will
burn his mouth,"" said the youth, and went into the next room. There hung
another kettle that bubbled and boiled. But there was no fire beneath
it, either. ""I must try this one, too,"" said the king's son, and again
he dipped in a lock of his hair and it grew just like silver. ""We have
no such expensive soup at home,"" said the king's son, ""but the main
thing is, how does it taste?"" and with that he went into the third room.

dipped in a lock of his hair, and it came out like pure gold, and fairly
shimmered.",144,copper,is a,reddish_brown,What is copper?,Copper is a reddish-brown metallic element.

into the fourth room. Here there was no kettle to be seen. But a maiden
sat on a bench who must have been a king's daughter. Yet whatever she
might be, the king's son had never seen any one so beautiful in all his
days. ""Now in heaven's name, what are you doing here?"" asked the maiden.
""I hired myself out here yesterday,"" said the king's son. ""May God be
your aid, for it is a fine service you have chosen!"" said she. ""O, the
master is very friendly,"" said the king's son. ""He has given me no hard
work to do to-day. When I have cleaned out the stable, I need do nothing
more."" ""Yes, but how are you going to manage it?"" she went on. ""If you
do as the others have done, then for every shovelful you pitch out, ten

long, for they had soon agreed that they would marry, he and the king's
daughter, and in this way his first day in the giant's service did not
weary him at all. When evening came on, she told him that now he must
clean out the stable before the giant came. When he got there he
thought he would try out her advice, and began to use the shovel as he
had seen his father's grooms use it. And sure enough, he had to stop
quickly. After he had worked a little while, he hardly had room in
which to stand. Then he did as the king's daughter had told him, turned
the shovel around and used the handle. And in a wink the stable was as
clean as though it had been scrubbed. When he had finished he went
to the room that the giant had assigned him, and walked up and down,
whistling and singing. Then the giant came home with his goats. ""Have
you cleaned out the stable?"" he asked. ""Yes, indeed, master, it is
spick and span,"" said the king's son. ""I'll have to see that,"" said the
giant, and went into the stable. It was just as the king's son had
said. ""You surely have been talking to the Master Girl, for you could
not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Master Girl? What is a
Master Girl?"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very stupid. ""I'd
like to see her, too."" ""You will see her in plenty of time,"" said the
giant.",94,shovel,is used for,digging,What do we use shovels for?,We use shovels for digging.

the king's son he was to fetch his horse from the pasture, and when he
had done this, he might rest: ""For you have come to a kind master,"" said
he. ""But if you enter one of the rooms which I forbade you entering
yesterday, I will tear off your head,"" he said, and went away with his
herd. ""Indeed, you are a kind master,"" said the king's son, ""but in
spite of it I'd like to have another little talk with the Master Girl,
for she is just as much mine as yours,"" and with that he went in to her.
She asked him what work he had to do that day. ""O, it is not so bad
to-day,"" said the king's son. ""I am only to fetch his horse from the
pasture."" ""And how are you going to manage that?"" asked the Master Girl.
""Surely it is no great feat to fetch a horse from pasture,"" said the
king's son, ""and I have ridden swift horses before."" ""Yet it is not an
easy matter to ride this horse home,"" said the Master Girl, ""but I will
tell you how to set about it. When you see the horse, he will come
running up, breathing fire and flame, just as though he were a burning
pine-torch. Then you must take the bit that is hanging here on the door,
and throw it into his mouth. Then he will grow so tame that you can
do what you will with him."" He would take good note of it, said the
king's son. He sat there with the Master Girl the whole day long. They chatted and talked about this and that, but mainly about how
delightful it would be, and what a pleasant time they could have, if
they could only marry and get away from the giant. And the king's son
would have forgotten the pasture and the horse altogether, had not the
Master Girl reminded him of them toward evening. He took the bit that
hung in the corner, hurried out to the pasture, and the horse at once
ran up, breathing fire and flame. He seized the moment when he came
running up to him with his jaws wide open, and threw the bit into his
mouth. Then he stood still, as gentle as a young lamb, and he had no
trouble bringing him to the stable. Then he went to his room again, and
began to whistle and sing.",182,pasture,is a,grassland,What is pasture?,Pasture is a field of grassland.

went into the stable. But there stood the horse, just as the king's son
had said. ""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl, for you
could not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Yesterday the master
chattered about the Master Girl, and to-day he is talking about her
again. I wish master would show me the creature, for I surely would like

king's son. ""When you have done that, you may rest for the remainder of
the time, for you have come to a kind master, and you might as well know
it,"" and with that he went off. ""You may be a kind master,"" said the
king's son. ""Yet you hand over some pretty mean jobs to me in spite of
it, but I think I'll look after your Master Girl a bit. You claim that
she belongs to you, but perhaps, in spite of it, she may tell me what to
do,"" and with that he went in to her. And when the Master Girl asked him
what the giant had given him to do that day, he told her he must go to
the devil and fetch a tribute. ""But how will you go about it?"" asked the
Master Girl. ""You will have to tell me that,"" said the king's son, ""for
I have never been to the devil's place. Even though I knew the way
there, I still would not know how much to ask for."" ""I will tell you
what you must do,"" said the Master Girl. ""You must go to the rock behind
the pasture, and take the club that is lying there, and strike the rock
with it. Then one will come out whose eyes flash fire, and you must tell
him your business. And if he asks how much you want, you must tell him
as much as you can carry.""",23,fetch,has subevent,bring,What does it mean to fetch?,To fetch means to get and bring something back.

the giant came home. So he set out, and did exactly as the Master Girl
had told him: he went to the rock, took the club and beat against it.
Then one came out from whose eyes and nose the sparks flew. ""What do you want?"" he asked. ""The giant has sent me to fetch his tribute,"" said the king's son. ""How much do you want?"" the other again inquired. ""I never ask for more than I can carry,"" was the reply of the king's son. ""It is lucky for you that you did not ask for a whole ton at once,"" said the one on the hill. ""But come in with me, and wait a while."" This the king's son did, and saw a great deal of gold and silver lying in the hill like dead rock in an ore-pile. Then as much as he could carry was packed up, and with it he went his way. When the giant came home in the evening with his goats, the king's son was running about the room, whistling and singing as on the two preceding evenings. ""Did you go to the devil for the tribute?"" asked the giant. ""Yes, indeed, master,"" said the king's son. ""Where did you put it?"" asked the giant again. ""I stood the sack of gold outside on the bench,"" was the reply. ""I must see that at once,"" said the giant, and went over to the bench. But the sack was really standing there, and it was so full that the gold and silver rolled right out when the giant loosened the string. ""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl,"" said the giant. ""If that is the case I will tear your head off."" ""With your Master Girl?"" said the king's
son. ""Yesterday master talked about that Master Girl, and to-day he is
talking about her again, and the day before yesterday he talked about
her, too! I only wish that I might get the chance to see her sometime!""
said he. ""Well, just wait until to-morrow,"" said the giant, ""and then I
will lead you to her myself,"" he said. ""A thousand thanks, master,"" said

He lay down on the bench to sleep, and at once began to snore so that the hills shook. Then the Master Girl took a knife, and cut the youth's little finger, and let three drops of blood fall on the bench.
Then she took all the old rags, and old shoes and other rubbish she
could find, and threw them all into the kettle. And then she took a
chest of gold-dust, and a lick-stone, and a bottle of water that hung
over the door, and a golden apple, and two golden hens. She left the

around, went to sleep again, and went on sleeping for quite some time.
Then he again turned around a little. ""Is dinner not ready yet?"" he
said, but did not open his eyes--nor had he done so the first time--for
he was still half asleep. ""It is half ready!"" called out the second drop
of blood, and then the giant thought it was the Master Girl. He turned
around on the bench and took another nap. After he had slept a couple of hours longer, he once more began to move about and stretch: ""Is dinner still not ready?"" said he. ""Ready!"" answered the third drop of blood. The giant sat up and rubbed his eyes. But he could not see who had called him, and so he called out to the Master Girl. But no one answered him. ""O, I suppose she has gone out for a little,"" thought the giant, and he dipped his spoon in the kettle to try the dinner. But there was nothing but leather soles and rags and like rubbish cooked together, and he did not know whether it were mush or porridge.

""Now you must throw the lick-stone overboard,"" said the Master Girl, and the king's son did so. It turned into a tremendous large rock square across the sea, and the giant could not get over, and the sea-sucker could drink up no more of the sea. ""I know quite well what I must do,"" said the giant. ""I must now fetch my hill-borer."" So the hill-borer came, and bored a hole through the rock, so the sea-sucker could get through and keep on sucking.

she was to wait by the seashore. So at last the Master Girl had to give
in.

food and drink, and offered him the best of all that had been prepared
for the wedding feast.

get away. Yet, finally, the bride's sister rolled an apple over to him
across the court-yard: ""And if you will touch nothing else, then at
least you might take a bite of the apple, for you must be hungry and
thirsty after your long journey,"" said she, and he took the apple and
bit into it. But no sooner did he have the bit of apple in his mouth

stay there. Now the little hut belonged to an old woman, and she was an
arrant and evil witch; at first she did not want to take in the Master
Girl at all; but at last she agreed to do so for love of money. But the
whole hut was as dark and dirty as a pig-sty; therefore the Master Girl
said she would clean up a bit, so that things would look as they did in
other, decent people's houses. The old woman would have none of it, and
was very disagreeable and angry; but the Master Girl paid no attention
to her. She took the chest of gold dust, and threw a handful into the
fire, so that a ray of gold shone over the whole hut, and it was gilded
outside and in. But when the gold flamed up, the old woman was so
terribly frightened that she ran out as though the evil one were after

Girl. Yes, he had quite a little, said the bailiff. Then he went home
to fetch his money, and came back again at evening dragging along an
enormous sack of it, which he stood on a bench before the door. The
Master Girl said that, seeing he had so much money, she would accept
him. And then she asked him to rake the fire, which she said she had
forgotten to do. But as soon as he had the poker in his hand, the Master
Girl cried: ""May God grant that you hold the poker, and the poker hold
you, and that sparks and ashes fly around you until morning!"" And there
the bailiff stood the whole night through, and sparks and ashes flew
about him, nor were the sparks the less hot for all his complaining and

He saw it glistening and shining in the woods, and went in to find out
who lived there. When he saw the beautiful girl he fell even more deeply
in love with her than the bailiff had, and lost no time in suing for her
hand. The Master Girl asked him, as she had asked the bailiff, whether
he had plenty of money. Money he had to spare, answered the clerk, and
ran right home to fetch it. By evening he was back again with a great
sack--it must have been as much again as the bailiff had brought--and
stood it on the bench. And so she promised to take him. Then she asked
him to shut the house-door, which she said she had forgotten to do. But
when he had the door-knob in his hand, she cried: ""May God grant that
you hold the door-knob and that the door-knob hold you, and that you
move back and forth with it all night long until morning!"" And the clerk
had to dance the whole night through, such a waltz as he had never
tripped before, and he had no wish to repeat the experience. Sometimes
he was ahead, and sometimes the door was, and so they went back and
forth all night, from wall to post and post to wall, and he was nearly
bruised to death. First he cursed, then he wailed and pleaded; but the
door paid no attention to him, and flung open and shut until it dawned.
When it at last released him, he hurried away as quickly as though he
had stolen something, forgot his sackful of money, and his wish to
marry, and was glad that the door did not come threshing along after
him. All grinned and stared at the clerk, for he ran like a madman, and

house in the forest. And he, too, went in to see who lived in it. And
when he saw the Master Girl, he fell so deeply in love with her that he
sued for her hand as soon as he bade her good-day. But she told him just
what she had told the others, that if he had plenty of money she would
take him. He had money enough, said the magistrate, and he went straight
home to fetch it. When he came back in the evening, he had a much bigger
sack of money with him than the clerk had had, and he stood it on the
bench. Then the Master Girl said she would take him. But first she
asked him to go fetch the calf, which she had forgotten to bring to the
stable. And when he had the calf by the tail she cried: ""May God grant
that you hold the calf's tail, and the calf's tail hold you, and that
you fly about the world together until morning!"" And with that the
race began, over stick and stone, over hill and dale, and the more the
magistrate cursed and yelled, the more madly the calf ran away. When it
dawned there was hardly a whole bone in the magistrate's body, and he
was so happy to be able to let go the calf's tail that he forgot his bag
of money, and the whole occurrence. It is true that he went home more
slowly than the bailiff and the clerk; but the slower he went the more

did he appear after his dance with the calf.",228,dale,is a,valley,What is a dale?,A dale is a valley.

giant as well, and he was to get the other bride's sister.

But when they entered the coach and were about to drive to church, one
of the axles broke. They took another, and then a third, but all of them
broke, no matter what kind of wood they used. It took a great deal of
time, and they did not move from the spot, and got all out of sorts.
Then the bailiff said, for he had also been invited to the wedding at
the castle, that a maiden lived out in the forest, and ""if they could
only get the loan of her poker, it would be sure to hold."" So they sent
to the little house in the forest, and asked most politely whether the

And they were worse off than they had been with the axle. Then the clerk said--for if the bailiff was one of the company, you may be sure they had not forgotten to invite the clerk--""Out in the forest lives a maiden, and if you will get the loan of her house-door, I am sure it would not break."" So they sent to the little house in the forest, and asked most politely whether the maiden would not loan them the golden house-door, of which the clerk had told them. And they got it, too, and were about to drive on, when suddenly the horses could not draw the coach. There were six, so they put to eight, and then ten and twelve, but though they put as many as they liked to the coach and helped along with the whip, still the coach would not budge. The day was already far advanced, and they simply had to get to church, and actually began to despair. But then the magistrate said that out in the golden house in the forest lived a maiden, ""and if one could only get the loan of her calf, it would be sure to pull the coach, and though it were as heavy as a bowlder."" They did not think it quite the thing to drive to church with a calf; but still there was nothing to do but to send to the maiden, and to ask her most politely, with a kind greeting from the king, if she would loan them the calf of which the magistrate had spoken. Nor did the Master Girl refuse them this time.
And then, when they had put the calf to the coach, it moved from the
spot quickly enough. It flew over stick and stone, hill and dale, so
that the people inside could hardly catch their breath. First it was
on the ground, and next it was in the air, and when they reached
the church, it spun around it like a top, and they had the greatest
difficulty in getting out and into the church. And going home they went

This seemed right to the king, so he sent five of his most distinguished courtiers to the little golden house. They were to carry the king's kindest greetings, and ask that the maiden come up to the castle and take dinner with them. ""A kind greeting to the king, and if he is too good to come to me, then I am too good to go to him,"" said the Master Girl. So the king had to go to her himself, and then she went along with him at once, and the king saw very well that she was more than she appeared to be, and gave her a place at the head of the table, next to the young bridegroom. After they had been at dinner for a while, the Master Girl produced the rooster and the hen and the golden apple--they were the three things she had taken along from the giant's castle--and placed them on the table before her. At once the rooster and the hen began to fight for the golden apple. ""Why, just see how the two fight for the golden apple!"" said the king's son. ""Yes, that is how we had to fight the time we wanted to get out of the rock!"" said the Master Girl. And then the king's son recognized her, and was very happy. The witch who had rolled the apple over to him was duly punished.

When this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter. She was the joy and pride of both their lives. In her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age.

What golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood. The visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old, her proud mother carrying her, robed in ceremonial kimono, to be put under the patronage of the family's household god. Then her first dolls festival, when her parents gave her a set of dolls and their miniature belongings, to be added to as year succeeded year. Then perhaps the most important occasion of all, on her third birthday, when her first OBI (broad brocade sash) of scarlet and gold was tied round her small waist. It a sign that she had crossed the threshold of girlhood and left infancy behind. Now that she was seven years of age, and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents, their cup of happiness seemed full.

All was ready at last, and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him.

""Do not be anxious, I will come back soon,"" said the man. ""While I am away take care of everything, and especially of our little daughter.""

""Yes, we shall be all right-but you-you must take care of yourself and delay not a day in coming back to us,"" said the wife, while the tears fell like rain from her eyes.

The little girl was the only one to smile, for she was ignorant of the sorrow of parting.

But he knew that he must go, for the call was imperative. With a great effort he ceased to think, and resolutely turning away he went quickly down the little garden and out through the gate.

In the intervals of her work she directed the little girl's games and taught her to read the old stories of her country. Thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband's absence. While the time was thus slipping quickly by in the quiet home, the husband finished his business and returned.

It would have been difficult for any one who did not know the man well to recognize him. He had traveled day after day, exposed to all weathers, for about a month altogether, and was sunburnt to bronze. But his fond wife and child knew him at a glance, and flew to meet him from either side, each catching hold of one of his sleeves in their eager greeting.

""Thank you,"" said the child, as she bowed her head to the ground. She then put out her hand just like a little maple leaf with its eager wide-spread fingers to take the doll and the box, both of which, coming from the capital, were prettier than anything she had ever seen. No words can tell how delighted the little girl was-her face seemed as if it would melt with joy, and she had no eyes and no thought for anything else.

She gazed into the shining disk, and looking up with surprise and wonder pictured on her face, she said:

The husband laughed and said:

Although there are none to be found in this out of the way place, yet they have been in use in the capital from the most ancient times. There the mirror is considered a very necessary requisite for a woman to possess. There is an old proverb that 'As the sword is the soul of a samurai, so is the mirror the soul of a woman,' and according to popular tradition, a woman's mirror is an index to her own heart-if she keeps it bright and clear, so is her heart pure and good.

The wife saw that her husband was very tired, and set about serving the evening meal and making everything as comfortable as she could for him.

The father and daughter were stricken with grief, and day or night the girl never left her mother's side. But in spite of all their efforts the woman's life was not to be saved.

One day as the girl sat near her mother's bed, trying to hide with a cheery smile the gnawing trouble at her heart, the mother roused herself and taking her daughter's hand, gazed earnestly and lovingly into her eyes. Her breath was labored and she spoke with difficulty:

""My daughter. I am sure that nothing can save me now. When I am dead, promise me to take care of your dear father and to try to be a good and dutiful woman.""

Her love for her dead mother did not grow less with time, and so keen was her remembrance, that everything in daily life, even the falling of the rain and the blowing of the wind, reminded her of her mother's death and of all that they had loved and shared together. One day when her father was out, and she was fulfilling her household duties alone, her loneliness and sorrow seemed more than she could bear. She threw herself down in her mother's room and wept as if her heart would break. Poor child, she longed just for one glimpse of the loved face, one sound of the voice calling her pet name, or for one moment's forgetfulness of the aching void in her heart. Suddenly she sat up. Her mother's last words had rung through her memory hitherto dulled by grief.

It was not her mother thin and wasted by illness, but the young and beautiful woman as she remembered her far back in the days of her own earliest childhood. It seemed to the girl that the face in the mirror must soon speak, almost that she heard the voice of her mother telling her again to grow up a good woman and a dutiful daughter, so earnestly did the eyes in the mirror look back into her own.

A year spent in mourning had thus passed away in the little household, when, by the advice of his relations, the man married again, and the daughter now found herself under the authority of a step-mother. It was a trying position; but her days spent in the recollection of her own beloved mother, and of trying to be what that mother would wish her to be, had made the young girl docile and patient, and she now determined to be filial and dutiful to her father's wife, in all respects.

Instead of lessening his affection for his daughter, as the woman desired, her grumblings only made him think of her the more.

Yet he remembered having noticed that his daughter stayed much in her room of late and kept herself away from every one, even when visitors came to the house. Putting this fact together with his wife's alarm, he thought that there might be something to account for the strange story.

His heart was torn between doubting his wife and trusting his child, and he knew not what to do. He decided to go at once to his daughter and try to find out the truth.

But she soon found that her efforts were in vain. The step-mother never trusted her, and seemed to misinterpret all her actions, and the poor child knew very well that she often carried unkind and untrue tales to her father. She could not help comparing her present unhappy condition with the time when her own mother was alive only a little more than a year ago-so great a change in this short time! Morning and evening she wept over the remembrance. Whenever she could she went to her room, and sliding the screens to, took out the mirror and gazed, as she thought, at her mother's face. It was the only comfort that she had in these wretched days.

Her father found her occupied in this way. Pushing aside the fusama, he saw her bending over something or other very intently. Looking over her shoulder, to see who was entering her room, the girl was surprised to see her father, for he generally sent for her when he wished to speak to her. She was also confused at being found looking at the mirror, for she had never told any one of her mother's last promise, but had kept it as the sacred secret of her heart. So before turning to her father she slipped the mirror into her long sleeve. Her father noting her confusion, and her act of hiding something, said in a severe manner:

""Then, is it really true that you are daily cursing your step-mother and praying for her death? Have you forgotten what I told you, that although she is your step-mother you must be obedient and loyal to her? What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked?

However stupid I may be, I should never be able to curse any one who belonged to you, much less pray for the death of one you love. Surely some one has been telling you lies, and you are dazed, and you know not what you say-or some evil spirit has taken possession of YOUR heart. As for me I do not know-no, not so much as a dew-drop, of the evil thing of which you accuse me.""

Then the daughter, though shy of confessing how she had cherished her mother's memory, saw that she must tell her father all in order to clear herself. So she slipped the mirror out from her long sleeve and laid it before him.

""This,"" she said, ""is what you saw me looking at just now.""

""Why,"" he said in great surprise, ""this is the mirror that I brought as a gift to your mother when I went up to the capital many years ago! And so you have kept it all this time? Now, why do you spend so much of your time before this mirror?""

Then she told him of her mother's last words, and of how she had promised to meet her child whenever she looked into the glass. But still the father could not understand the simplicity of his daughter's character in not knowing that what she saw reflected in the mirror was in reality her own face, and not that of her mother.

""What do you mean?"" he asked. ""I do not understand how you can meet the soul of your lost mother by looking in this mirror?""

""It is indeed true,"" said the girl: ""and if you don't believe what I say, look for yourself,"" and she placed the mirror before her. There, looking back from the smooth metal disk, was her own sweet face. She pointed to the reflection seriously:

""Do you doubt me still?"" she asked earnestly, looking up into his face.

You are truly a faithful child. It seems at first a stupid thing to have done, but it is not really so, It shows how deep has been your filial piety, and how innocent your heart. Living in constant remembrance of your lost mother has helped you to grow like her in character. How clever it was of her to tell you to do this. I admire and respect you, my daughter, and I am ashamed to think that for one instant I believed your suspicious step-mother's story and suspected you of evil, and came with the intention of scolding you severely, while all this time you have been so true and good. Before you I have no countenance left, and I beg you to forgive me.""

And here the father wept. He thought of how lonely the poor girl must have been, and of all that she must have suffered under her step-mother's treatment. His daughter steadfastly keeping her faith and simplicity in the midst of such adverse circumstances-bearing all her troubles with so much patience and amiability-made him compare her to the lotus which rears its blossom of dazzling beauty out of the slime and mud of the moats and ponds, fitting emblem of a heart which keeps itself unsullied while passing through the world.",256,lotus,is a,flower,What is a lotus?,A lotus is a kind of aquatic flower.

Through no fault of yours, but with a step-mother's jealous heart, I have disliked you all the time. Hating you so much myself, it was but natural that I should think you reciprocated the feeling, and thus when I saw you retire so often to your room I followed you, and when I saw you gaze daily into the mirror for long intervals, I concluded that you had found out how I disliked you, and that you were out of revenge trying to take my life by magic art. As long as I live I shall never forget the wrong I have done you in so misjudging you, and in causing your father to suspect you. From this day I throw away my old and wicked heart, and in its place I put a new one, clean and full of repentance. I shall think of you as a child that I have borne myself. I shall love and cherish you with all my heart, and thus try to make up for all the unhappiness I have caused you.

morraha,1,"Morraha rose in the morning, and washed his hands and face, and said his
prayers, and ate his food. He asked God to prosper the day for him;
and he went down to the brink of the sea, and he saw a currach, short
and green, coming towards him. In it there was but one youthful
champion, and he playing hurly from prow to stern of the currach. He had
a hurl of gold and a ball of silver. He stopped not until the
currach was in on the shore. He drew her up on the green grass, and
put fastening on her for a day and a year, whether he should be there
all that time, or should only be on land for an hour by the clock. And
Morraha saluted the young man in words intelligent, intelligible, such
as were spoken at that time. The other saluted him in the same
fashion, and asked him would he play a game of cards with him; and
Morraha said he had not the wherewithal. The other answered that he
was never without a candle or the making of it. He put his hand in
his pocket and drew out a table and two chairs and a pack of cards, and
they sat down on the chairs and went to the card-playing. The first game
Morraha won, and the slender red champion bade him make his claim. He said that the land above him should be filled with stock of sheep in
the morning. It was well, and he played no second game, but home he
went.

The next day Morraha went to the brink of the sea, and the young man
came in the currach and asked him would he play cards. They played,
and Morraha won. And the young man bade him make his claim. He said
that the land above should be filled with cattle in the morning. It was

asked him would he play cards. And they played, and Morraha won the
game. The young man bade him give his claim. And he said he should
have a castle, and of women the finest and fairest; and they were his.
It was well, and the young man went away.

On the fourth day the woman asked him how he had found himself, and he
told her. ""And I am going out,"" said he, ""to play again to-day.""

""I cross (forbid) you go again to him. If you have won so much, you
will lose more. Have no more to do with him.""

But he went against her will, and he saw the currach coming, and the
young man was driving his balls from end to end of the currach. He had
balls of silver and a hurl of gold, and he stopped not till he drew his
boat on the shore, and made her fast for a year and a day. And Morraha
and he saluted each other. He asked Morraha if he would play a game
of cards, and they played and he won. And Morraha said to him, ""Give
your claim, now.""

Said he, ""You will hear it too soon. I lay on you the bonds of the art

the chair broke in pieces.

""It is the son of a king under spells you are,"" said his wife, ""And you
had better have taken my counsel than that the spells should be on you.""
He said to her to bring news of the death of Anshgayliacht and the sword
of light to the slender red champion.

""Go out,"" said she, ""in the morning of the morrow, and take the bridle
in the window and shake it. Whatever beast, handsome or ugly, puts
the head in it, take that one with you. Do not speak a word to her till
she speaks to you. Take with you three pint bottles of ale and three
sixpenny loaves, and do the thing she tells you. When she runs to my
father's land, on a height above the court, she will shake herself, and
the bells will ring, and my father will say Brown Allree is in the land.
And if the son of a king or queen is there, bring him to me on your
shoulders. If it is the son of a poor man, let him come no further.""

He rose in the morning, and took the bridle that was in the window and
went out and shook it, and Brown Allree came and put her head in it. And
he took the three loaves and three bottles of ale, and went riding. When he was riding, she bent her head down to take hold of her feet with
her mouth, in hopes he would speak in ignorance. He spoke not a word
during the time, and the mare at last spoke to him, and said to him to
dismount and give her her dinner. He gave her the sixpenny loaf toasted
and a bottle of ale to drink. ""Sit up, now, riding and take good heed of
yourself: there are three miles of fire I have to clear at a leap.""",100,morrow,is a,day,What is the morrow?,The morrow is the next or following day.

riding, and he said he was. They went on then, and she told him to
dismount and give her a meal. He did so, and gave her a sixpenny
loaf and a bottle. She consumed them, and said to him there were
before them three miles of hill covered with steel thistles, and that
she must clear it. And she cleared the hill with a leap, and she asked
him if he were still riding, and he said he was. They went on, and she
went not far before she told him to give her a meal, and he gave her the
bread and the bottleful. And she went over three miles of sea with a
leap, and she came then to the land of the King of France. She went
up on a height above the castle, and she shook herself and neighed, and
the bells rang. The King said that it was Brown Allree was in the
land. ""Go out,"" said he, ""and if it is the son of a king or queen, carry
him in on your shoulders; if it is not, leave him there.""

They went out, and the stars of the son of a king were on his breast;
and they lifted him high on their shoulders and bore him in to the King.
And they passed the night cheerfully with playing and with drinking,
with sport and with diversion, till the whiteness of the day came upon
the morrow morning.

Then the young King told the cause of his journey, and he asked of the
Queen her counsel and consent, and to give him counsel and good luck,
and the woman told him everything she advised him to do. ""Go now,"" said
she, ""and take with you the best mare in the stable, and go to the door
of Rough Niall of the speckled rock, and knock, and call on him to give
you news of the death of Anshgayliacht and the sword of light; and let
the horse's back be to the door, and apply the spurs, and away with
you!""",74,thistle,is a,weed,What are thistles?,Thistles are a kind of weed with prickly leaves.

and rode to the door of Niall, and turned the horse's back to the door,
and demanded news of the death of Anshgayliacht, and the sword of light. He applied the spurs, and away with him. And Niall followed him, and
as he was passing the gate cut the horse in two. And the mother was
there with a dish of puddings and flesh, and she threw it in his eyes
and blinded him, and said, ""Fool, whatever kind of man it is that's
mocking you, isn't that a fine condition you have got into on your
father's horse?""

On the morning of the next day Morraha rose and took another horse from
the stable, and went again to the door of Niall, and knocked and
demanded news of the death of Anshgayliacht, and the sword of light, and
applied the spurs to the horse, and away with him. And Niall followed,
and as he was passing the gate cut the horse in two, and took half the
saddle with him, and his mother met him, and threw the flesh in his eyes
and blinded him.

And on the third day Morraha went also to the door of Niall. Niall
followed him, and as he was passing the gate cut away the saddle from
under him and the clothes from his back. Then his mother said to Niall:

""Whatever fool it is that's mocking you, he is out yonder in the little
currach, going home; and take good heed to yourself, and don't sleep one
wink for three days.""

in and took hold of the sword that was on the bed at his head. And the
sword thought to draw itself out of the hand of Morraha, but it failed.
And then it gave a cry, and it wakened Niall, and Niall said it was a
rude and rough thing to come into his house like that. Morraha said
to him:

""Leave your much talking, or I will cut the head off you. Tell me the
news of the death of Anshgayliacht.""

""Oh, you can have my head.""

""But your head is no good to me. Tell me the story.""

""Oh,"" said Niall's wife, ""you must get the story.""

""Oh,"" said Morraha, ""is the woman your wife?""

""Oh,"" said the man, ""is it not you that have the story?""

""Oh,"" said she, ""you will tell it to us.""

""Well,"" said the man, ""let us sit down together till I tell the story. I
thought no one would ever get it, but now it will be heard by all.""

When I was growing up my mother taught me the language of the birds, and
when I got married I used to be listening to their conversation. I
would be laughing, and my wife would be asking me what was the reason of
my laughing. I did not like to tell her, as women are always asking
questions. We went out walking one fine morning, and the birds were
arguing with one another. One of them said to another:

""Why should you be making comparison with me, when there is not a king
nor knight that does not come to look at my tree?""",349,knight,is capable of,ride_horse,What are knights capable of?,Knights are capable of riding horses and fighting battles.
morraha,7,"""Oh, what advantage has your tree over mine, on which there are three
rods of magic and mastery growing?""

When I heard them arguing, and knew that the rods were there, I began to
laugh.

""Oh,"" said my wife, ""why are you always laughing? I believe it is at
myself you are jesting, and I'll walk with you no more.""

""Oh, it is not about you I am laughing. It is because I understand the
language of the birds.""

Then I had to tell her what the birds were saying to one another. She was greatly delighted, and she asked me to go home, and she gave
orders to the cook to have breakfast ready at six o'clock in the
morning. I did not know why she was going out early, and breakfast was
ready in the morning at the hour she appointed. She asked me to go out
walking. I went with her. She went to the tree, and asked me to cut a
rod for her.

""Oh, I will not cut it. Are we not better without it?""

""I will not leave this till I get the rod, to see if there is any good
in it.""

I cut the rod, and gave it to her. She turned from me, and struck a blow
on a stone and changed it. She struck a second blow on me, and made
of me a black raven, and she went home, and left me after her. I thought
she would come back. She did not come, and I had to go into a tree till
morning. In the morning, at six o'clock, there was a bellman out,
proclaiming that everyone who killed a raven would get a fourpenny bit.
At last you would not find man or boy without a gun, nor, if you were to
walk three miles, a raven that was not killed. I had to make a nest in
the top of the parlour chimney, and hide myself all day till night came,
and go out to pick up a bit to support me, till I spent a month. Here
she is herself (to say) if it is a lie I am telling.

""It is not,"" said she.",329,bellman,is a,worker,What is a bellman?,A bellman is a worker whose duty is to ring a bell to tell the time.
morraha,8,"Then I saw her out walking. I went up to her, and I thought she would
turn me back to my own shape, and she struck me with the rod and made of
me an old white horse. She ordered me to be put to a cart with a man
to draw stones from morning till night. I was worse off then. She
spread abroad a report that I had died suddenly in my bed, and prepared
a coffin, and waked me, and buried me. Then she had no trouble. But when
I got tired, I began to kill everyone who came near me, and I used to go
into the haggard every night and destroy the stacks of corn. When a
man came near me in the morning, I would follow him till I broke his
bones. Everyone got afraid of me. When she saw I was doing mischief, she
came to meet me, and I thought she would change me. And she did change
me, and made a fox of me. When I saw she was doing me every sort of
damage, I went away from her. I knew there was a badger's hole in the
garden, and I went there till night came, and I made great slaughter
among the ducks and geese. There she is herself to say if I am telling a
lie.

""Oh, you are telling nothing but the truth, only less than the truth.""

When she had enough of my killing the fowl, she came out into the
garden, for she knew I was in the badger's hole. She came to me, and
made me a wolf. I had to be off, and go to an island, where no one at
all would see me, and now and then I used to be killing sheep, for there
were not many of them, and I was afraid of being seen and hunted; and so
I passed a year, till a shepherd saw me among the sheep, and a pursuit
was made after me. And when the dogs came near me, there was no place
for me to escape to from them; but I recognised the sign of the King
among the men, and I made for him, and the King cried out to stop the
hounds. I took a leap upon the front of the King's saddle, and the woman
behind cried out, ""My King and my lord, kill him, or he will kill you.""",218,badger,is a,musteline_mammal,What is a badger?,A badger is a musteline mammal.
morraha,9,"""Oh, he will not kill me. He knew me; and must be pardoned.""

And the King took me home with him, and gave orders that I should be
well cared for. I was so wise when I got food I would not eat one morsel
until I got a knife and fork. The man told the King, and the King came
to see if it was true, and I got a knife and fork, and I took the knife
in one paw and the fork in the other, and I bowed to the King. The King
gave orders to bring him drink, and it came; and the King filled a glass
of wine, and gave it to me.

I took hold of it in my paw, and drank it, and thanked the King.

""Oh, on my honour, it is some king that has lost him when he came on the
island; and I will keep him, as he is trained. Perhaps he will
serve us yet.""

And this is the sort of King he was--a King who had not a child living.
Eight sons were born to him and three daughters, and they were stolen
the same night they were born. No matter what guard was placed over
them, the child would be gone in the morning. The Queen was now carrying
the twelfth child, and when she was lying-in, the King took me with him
to watch the baby. The women were not satisfied with me. ""Oh,"" said the
King, ""what was all your watching ever? One that was born to me I have
not; and I will leave this one in the dog's care, and he will not let it
go.""",128,wine,is a,alcoholic_beverage,What is wine?,Wine is an alcoholic beverage made of grape juice.
morraha,10,"A coupling was put between me and the cradle, and when everyone went to
sleep I was watching till the person woke who attended in the daytime;
but I was there only two nights when, it was near the day, I saw the
hand coming down through the chimney, and the hand was so big that it
took round the child altogether, and thought to take him away. I caught
hold of the hand above the wrist, and, as I was fastened to the cradle,
I did not let go my hold till I cut the hand from the wrist, and there
was a howl from the person without. I laid the hand in the cradle with
the child, and, as I was tired, I fell asleep. When I awoke I had
neither child nor hand. I began to howl, and the King heard me, and
he cried out that something was wrong with me, and he sent servants to
see what was the matter with me, and when the messenger came he saw me
covered with blood, and he could not see the child. He went to the
King, and told him the child was not to be got. The King came, and saw
the cradle coloured with the blood, and he cried out, ""Where was the
child gone?"" and everyone said it was the dog had eaten it.

The King said, ""It is not: loose him, and he will get the pursuit
himself.""

When I was loosed, I found the scent of the blood till I came to a door
of the room in which the child was. I went to the King, and took hold of
him, and went back again, and began to tear at the door. The King
followed me, and asked for the key. The servant said it was in the room
of the stranger woman. The King caused search to be made for her, and
she was not to be found. ""I will break the door,"" said the King, ""as I
can't get the key."" The King broke the door, and I went in, and went to
the trunk, and the King asked for a key to unlock it. He got no key, and
he broke the lock. When he opened the trunk the child and the hand were
stretched side by side, and the child was asleep. The King took the
hand, and ordered a woman to come for the child, and he showed the hand
to everyone in the house. But the stranger woman was gone, and she did
not see the King; and here she is herself to say if I am telling lies of
her.",83,wrist,is a,joint,What is a wrist?,A wrist is a joint that connects the hand and the arm.

The King did not allow me to be tied any more. He said there was nothing
so much to wonder at as that I cut the hand off, and I tied.

The child was growing till he was a year old, and he was beginning to
walk, and there was no one caring for him more than I was. He was
growing till he was three, and he was running out every minute. So the
King ordered a silver chain to be put between me and the child, so that
he might not go away from me. I was out with him in the garden every
day, and the King was as proud as the world of the child. He would be
watching him every place we went, till the child grew so wise that he
would loose the chain and get off. But one day that he loosed it I
failed to find him. I ran into the house and searched the house, but
there was no getting him for me. The King cried to go out and find the
child, that he had got loose from the dog. They went searching for him,
but they could not find him. When they failed altogether to find him,
there remained no more favour with the King towards me, and everyone
disliked me, and I grew weak, for I did not get a morsel to eat half the
time. When summer came I said I would try and go home to my own country.
I went away one fine morning, and I went swimming, and God helped me
till I came home. I went into the garden, for I knew there was a place
in the garden where I could hide myself, for fear she should see me. In
the morning I saw my wife out walking, and my child with her, held by
the hand. I pushed out to see the child, and, as he was looking about
him everywhere, he saw me, and called out, ""I see my shaggy papa. Oh,""
said he; ""oh, my heart's love, my shaggy papa, come here till I see
you.""",100,chain,has subevent,fasten,What is the function of a chain?,A chain is used to get something fastened or locked.
morraha,12,"I was afraid the woman would see me, as she was asking the child where
he saw me, and he said I was up in a tree. The more the child called
me, the more I hid myself. The woman took the child home with her, but I
knew he would be up early in the morning.

I went to the parlour window, and the child was within, and he playing.
When he saw me, he cried out, ""Oh, my heart's love, come here till I see
you, shaggy papa."" I broke the window, and went in, and he began to kiss
me. I saw the rod in front of the chimney, and I jumped up at the rod
and knocked it down. ""Oh, my heart's love, no one would give me the
pretty rod."" I thought he would strike me with the rod, but he did not.
When I saw the time was short, I raised my paw, and I gave him a scratch
below the knee. ""Oh, you naughty, dirty, shaggy papa! You have hurt me
so much--I'll give yourself a blow of the rod."" He struck me a light
blow, and as there was no sin on him, I came back to my own shape again.
When he saw a man standing before him he gave a cry, and I took him up
in my arms. The servants heard the child. A maid came in to see what was
the matter with him. When she saw me she gave a cry out of her, and she
said, ""Oh, my soul to God, if the master isn't come to life again.""

Another came in, and said it was he, really. And when the mistress heard
of it, she came to see with her own eyes, for she would not believe I
was there. When she saw me she said she'd drown herself. And I said
to her, ""If you yourself will keep the secret, no living man will ever
get the story from me until I lose my head.""

Many's the man has come asking for the story, and I never let one
return; but now everyone will know it, but she is as much to blame as I.

say I have been telling anything but the truth.",395,secret,is a,information,What is a secret?,A secret is a piece of knowledge kept unknown to others.

When I saw I was in a man's shape I said I would take the child back to
his father and mother, as I knew the grief they were in after him. I
got a ship, and took the child with me. When I was journeying I came
to land on an island, and I saw not a living soul on it, only a court,
dark and gloomy. I went in to see was there anyone in it. There was no
one but an old hag, tall and frightful, and she asked me, ""What sort of
person are you?"" I heard someone groaning in another room, and I said I
was a doctor, and I asked her what ailed the person who was groaning.

""Oh,"" said she, ""it is my son, whose hand has been bitten from his wrist
by a dog.""

I knew then it was the boy who was taking the child from me, and I said
I would cure him if I got a good reward.

""I have nothing, but there are eight young lads and three young women,
as handsome as anyone laid eyes on, and if you cure him I will give you
them.""

""But tell me in what place his hand was cut from.""

""Oh, it was out in another country twelve years ago.""

""Show me the way, that I may see him.""

She brought me into a room, so that I saw him, and his arm was swelled
up to the shoulder. He asked if I would cure him. I said I could
cure him if he would give me the reward his mother promised.

""Oh, I will give it, but cure me.""

""Well, bring them out to me.""",147,ail,has subevent,suffer,What does it mean to ail?,To ail means to cause suffering.
morraha,14,"The hag brought them out of the room. I said I would burn the flesh that
was on his arm. When I looked on him he was howling with pain. I said
that I would not leave him in pain long. The thief had only one eye in
his forehead. I took a bar of iron, and put it in the fire till it was
red, and I said to the hag, ""He will be howling at first, but will fall
asleep presently, and do not wake him until he has slept as much as he
wants. I will close the door when I am going out."" I took the bar with
me, and I stood over him, and I turned it across through his eye as far
as I could. He began to bellow, and tried to catch me, but I was out and
away, having closed the door. The hag asked me, ""Why is he bellowing?""

""Oh, he will be quiet presently, and will sleep for a good while, and
I'll come again to have a look at him. Bring me out the young men
and the young women.""

I took them with me, and I said to her, ""Tell me where you got them.""

""Oh, my son brought them with him, and they are the offspring of the one
King.""

I was well satisfied, and I had no liking for delay to get myself free
from the hag, and I took them on board the ship, and the child I had
myself. I thought the King might leave me the child I nursed myself. But
when I came to land, and all those young people with me, the King and
Queen were out walking. The King was very aged, and the Queen aged
likewise. When I came to converse with them, and the twelve with me, the
King and Queen began to cry. I asked, ""Why are you crying?""",172,hag,is a,old_woman,What is a hag?,"A hag is a witch, typically with the appearance of an old woman."

should have, and now I am withered, grey, at the end of my life, and I
have not one at all.""

""Oh, belike, you will yet have plenty.""

I told him all I went through, and I gave him the child in his hand,
and: ""These are your other children who were stolen from you, whom I am
giving to you safe. They are gently reared.""

When the King heard who they were, he smothered them with kisses and
drowned them with tears, and dried them with fine cloths, silken, and
the hairs of his own head, and so also did their mother, and great was
his welcome for me, as it was I who found them all. And the King said to
me, ""I will give you your own child, as it is you who have earned him
best; but you must come to my court every year, and the child with you,
and I will share with you my possessions.""

""Oh, I have enough of my own, and after my death I will leave it to the
child.""

to the Slender Red Champion and gave him the Sword of Light, and he was
well pleased to get them, and he took the spells of Morraha, and he had

mother-hulda,1,"A WIDOW had two daughters; one was pretty and industrious, the other was ugly and lazy. And as the ugly one was her own daughter, she loved her much the best, and the pretty one was made to do all the work, and be the drudge of the house. Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well on the high road and spin until her fingers bled. Now it happened once that as the spindle was bloody, she dipped it into the well to wash it; but it slipped out of her hand and fell in. Then she began to cry, and ran to her step-mother, and told her of her misfortune; and her step-mother scolded her without mercy, and said in her rage,

After that she knew nothing; and when she came to herself she was in a beautiful meadow, and the sun was shining on the flowers that grew round her. And she walked on through the meadow until she came to a baker's oven that was full of bread; and the bread called out to her, 
""Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am baked enough already!"" 
Then she drew near, and with the baker's peel she took out all the loaves one after the other. And she went farther on till she came to a tree weighed down with apples, and it called out to her,

So that Mother Hulda soon grew tired of her, and gave her warning, at which the lazy thing was well pleased, and thought that now the shower of gold was coming; so Mother Hulda led her to the door, and as she stood in the doorway, instead of the shower of gold a great kettle full of pitch was emptied over her.",206,kettle,is used for,boil_water,What do we do with a kettle?,We use a kettle to boil water.

moti,1,"Once upon a time there was a youth called Moti, who was very big and
strong, but the clumsiest creature you can imagine. So clumsy was he
that he was always putting his great feet into the bowls of sweet milk
or curds which his mother set out on the floor to cool, always smashing,
upsetting, breaking, until at last his father said to him:

'Here, Moti, are fifty silver pieces which are the savings of years;
take them and go and make your living or your fortune if you can.'

Then Moti started off one early spring morning with his thick staff over
his shoulder, singing gaily to himself as he walked along.

In one way and another he got along very well until a hot evening when
he came to a certain city where he entered the travellers' 'serai' or
inn to pass the night. Now a serai, you must know, is generally just a
large square enclosed by a high wall with an open colonnade along the
inside all round to accommodate both men and beasts, and with perhaps
a few rooms in towers at the corners for those who are too rich or too
proud to care about sleeping by their own camels and horses. Moti, of
course, was a country lad and had lived with cattle all his life, and
he wasn't rich and he wasn't proud, so he just borrowed a bed from the
innkeeper, set it down beside an old buffalo who reminded him of home,
and in five minutes was fast asleep.",43,milk,has property,white,What's the color of milk?,White.
moti,2,"In the middle of the night he woke, feeling that he had been disturbed,
and putting his hand under his pillow found to his horror that his bag
of money had been stolen. He jumped up quietly and began to prowl around
to see whether anyone seemed to be awake, but, though he managed to
arouse a few men and beasts by falling over them, he walked in the
shadow of the archways round the whole serai without coming across a
likely thief. He was just about to give it up when he overheard two men
whispering, and one laughed softly, and peering behind a pillar, he saw
two Afghan horsedealers counting out his bag of money! Then Moti went
back to bed!

In the morning Moti followed the two Afghans outside the city to the
horsemarket in which they horses were offered for sale. Choosing the
best-looking horse amongst them he went up to it and said:

'Is this horse for sale? may I try it?' and, the merchants assenting, he
scrambled up on its back, dug in his heels, and off they flew. Now Moti
had never been on a horse in his life, and had so much ado to hold on
with both hands as well as with both legs that the animal went just
where it liked, and very soon broke into a break-neck gallop and made
straight back to the serai where it had spent the last few nights.",187,merchant,is capable of,sell_goods,Who sell goods for profit?,Merchants.
moti,3,"'This will do very well,' thought Moti as they whirled in at the
entrance. As soon as the horse had arrived at its table it stopped of
its own accord and Moti immediately rolled off; but he jumped up at
once, tied the beast up, and called for some breakfast. Presently the
Afghans appeared, out of breath and furious, and claimed the horse.

'What do you mean?' cried Moti, with his mouth full of rice, 'it's my
horse; I paid you fifty pieces of silver for it--quite a bargain, I'm
sure!'

'Nonsense! it is our horse,' answered one of the Afghans beginning to
untie the bridle.

'Leave off,' shouted Moti, seizing his staff; 'if you don't let my horse
alone I'll crack your skulls! you thieves! I know you! Last night you
took my money, so to-day I took your horse; that's fair enough!'",55,breakfast,is a,first_meal_of_day,What is the first meal of the day?,Breakfast.
moti,4,"Now the Afghans began to look a little uncomfortable, but Moti seemed so
determined to keep the horse that they resolved to appeal to the law, so
they went off and laid a complaint before the king that Moti had stolen
one of their horses and would not give it up nor pay for it.

Presently a soldier came to summon Moti to the king; and, when he
arrived and made his obeisance, the king began to question him as to why
he had galloped off with the horse in this fashion. But Moti declared
that he had got the animal in exchange for fifty pieces of silver,
whilst the horse merchants vowed that the money they had on them was
what they had received for the sale of other horses; and in one way and
another the dispute got so confusing that the king (who really thought
that Moti had stolen the horse) said at last, 'Well, I tell you what
I will do. I will lock something into this box before me, and if he
guesses what it is, the horse is his, and if he doesn't then it is
yours.'

To this Moti agreed, and the king arose and went out alone by a
little door at the back of the Court, and presently came back clasping
something closely wrapped up in a cloth under his robe, slipped it into
the little box, locked the box, and set it up where all might see.",35,complaint,is a,objection,How to express objections?,With complaint.
moti,5,"'Now,' said the king to Moti, 'guess!'

It happened that when the king had opened the door behind him, Moti
noticed that there was a garden outside: without waiting for the king's
return he began to think what could be got out of the garden small
enough to be shut in the box. 'Is it likely to be a fruit or a flower?
No, not a flower this time, for he clasped it too tight. Then it must
be a fruit or a stone. Yet not a stone, because he wouldn't wrap a dirty
stone in his nice clean cloth. Then it is a fruit! And a fruit without
much scent, or else he would be afraid that I might smell it. Now what
fruit without much scent is in season just now? When I know that I shall
have guessed the riddle!'

As has been said before, Moti was a country lad, and was accustomed
to work in his father's garden. He knew all the common fruits, so he
thought he ought to be able to guess right; but so as not to let it
seem too easy, he gazed up at the ceiling with a puzzled expression, and
looked down at the floor with an air or wisdom and his fingers pressed
against his forehead, and then he said, slowly, with his eyes on the
king,--

'It is freshly plucked! It is round and it is red! It is a pomegranate!'",146,scent,is a,smell,What is scent?,A distinctive smell.
moti,6,"Now the king knew nothing about fruits except that they were good to
eat; and, as for seasons, he asked for whatever fruit he wanted whenever
he wanted it, and saw that he got it; so to him Moti's guess was like
a miracle, and clear proof not only of his wisdom but of his innocence,
for it was a pomegranate that he had put into the box. Of course when
the king marvelled and praised Moti's wisdom, everybody else did so too;
and, whilst the Afghans went off crestfallen, Moti took the horse and
entered the king's service.

Very soon after this, Moti, who continued to live in the serai, came
back one wet and stormy evening to find that his precious horse had
strayed. Nothing remained of him but a broken halter cord, and no one
knew what had become of him. After inquiring of everyone who was likely
to know, Moti seized the cord and his big staff and sallied out to
look for him. Away and away he tramped out of the city and into the
neighbouring forest, tracking hoof-marks in the mud. Presently it
grew late, but still Moti wandered on until suddenly in the gathering
darkness he came right upon a tiger who was contentedly eating his
horse.",82,marvel,has subevent,express,What do people do when they marvel at something?,They express their admiration and surprise.
moti,7,"'You thief!' shrieked Moti, and ran up and, just as the tiger, in
astonishment, dropped a bone--whack! came Moti's staff on his head with
such good will that the beast was half stunned and could hardly breathe
or see. Then Moti continued to shower upon him blows and abuse until the
poor tiger could hardly stand, whereupon his tormentor tied the end of
the broken halter round his neck and dragged him back to the serai.

'If you had my horse,' he said, 'I will at least have you, that's fair
enough!' And he tied him up securely by the head and heels, much as he
used to tie the horse; then, the night being far gone, he flung himself
beside him and slept soundly.

You cannot imagine anything like the fright of the people in the
serai, when they woke up and found a tiger--very battered but still
a tiger--securely tethered amongst themselves and their beasts! Men
gathered in groups talking and exclaiming, and finding fault with the
innkeeper for allowing such a dangerous beast into the serai, and all
the while the innkeeper was just as troubled as the rest, and none dared
go near the place where the tiger stood blinking miserably on everyone,
and where Moti lay stretched out snoring like thunder.",250,snore,has subevent,sleep_with_mouth_open,Why do people snore?,Because they sleep with mouth open.
moti,8,"At last news reached the king that Moti had exchanged his horse for a
live tiger; and the monarch himself came down, half disbelieving the
tale, to see if it were really true. Someone at last awaked Moti with
the news that his royal master was come; and he arose yawning, and was
soon delightedly explaining and showing off his new possession. The
king, however, did not share his pleasure at all, but called up a
soldier to shoot the tiger, much to the relief of all the inmates of the
serai except Moti. If the king, however, was before convinced that Moti
was one of the wisest of men, he was now still more convinced that he
was the bravest, and he increased his pay a hundredfold, so that our
hero thought that he was the luckiest of men.

A week or two after this incident the king sent for Moti, who on arrival
found his master in despair. A neighbouring monarch, he explained, who
had many more soldiers than he, had declared war against him, and he was
at his wits' end, for he had neither money to buy him off nor soldiers
enough to fight him--what was he to do?

'If that is all, don't you trouble,' said Moti. 'Turn out your men, and
I'll go with them, and we'll soon bring this robber to reason.'",182,monarch,is capable of,govern_nation,Who governs the nation in the state of a constitutional monarchy?,The monarch.
moti,9,"The king began to revive at these hopeful words, and took Moti off to
his stable where he bade him choose for himself any horse he liked.
There were plenty of fine horses in the stalls, but to the king's
astonishment Moti chose a poor little rat of a pony that was used to
carry grass and water for the rest of the stable.

'But why do you choose that beast?' said the king.

'Well, you see, your majesty,' replied Moti, 'there are so many chances
that I may fall off, and if I choose one of your fine big horses I shall
have so far to fall that I shall probably break my leg or my arm, if not
my neck, but if I fall off this little beast I can't hurt myself much.'

A very comical sight was Moti when he rode out to the war. The only
weapon he carried was his staff, and to help him to keep his balance
on horseback he had tied to each of his ankles a big stone that nearly
touched the ground as he sat astride the little pony. The rest of the
king's cavalry were not very numerous, but they pranced along in armour
on fine horses. Behind them came a great rabble of men on foot armed
with all sorts of weapons, and last of all was the king with his
attendants, very nervous and ill at ease. So the army started.",193,ankle,is part of,leg,What is ankle?,The skeletal joint which connects the foot with the leg.
moti,10,"They had not very far to go, but Moti's little pony, weighted with a
heavy man and two big rocks, soon began to lag behind the cavalry,
and would have lagged behind the infantry too, only they were not very
anxious to be too early in the fight, and hung back so as to give Moti
plenty of time. The young man jogged along more and more slowly for some
time, until at last, getting impatient at the slowness of the pony,
he gave him such a tremendous thwack with his staff that the pony
completely lost his temper and bolted. First one stone became untied
and rolled away in a cloud of dust to one side of the road, whilst Moti
nearly rolled off too, but clasped his steed valiantly by its ragged
mane, and, dropping his staff, held on for dear life. Then, fortunately
the other rock broke away from his other leg and rolled thunderously
down a neighbouring ravine. Meanwhile the advanced cavalry had barely
time to draw to one side when Moti came dashing by, yelling bloodthirsty
threats to his pony:

'You wait till I get hold of you! I'll skin you alive! I'll wring your
neck! I'll break every bone in your body!' The cavalry thought that
this dreadful language was meant for the enemy, and were filled with
admiration of his courage. Many of their horses too were quite upset by
this whirlwind that galloped howling through their midst, and in a few
minutes, after a little plunging and rearing and kicking, the whole
troop were following on Moti's heels.",200,yell,has subevent,hurt_throat,What happens if one often yells?,He may hurt his throat.
moti,11,"Far in advance, Moti continued his wild career. Presently in his course
he came to a great field of castor-oil plants, ten or twelve feet high,
big and bushy, but quite green and soft. Hoping to escape from the back
of his fiery steed Moti grasped one in passing, but its roots gave
way, and he dashed on, with the whole plant looking like a young tree
flourishing in his grip.

The enemy were in battle array, advancing over the plain, their king
with them confident and cheerful, when suddenly from the front came a
desperate rider at a furious gallop.

'Sire!' he cried, 'save yourself! the enemy are coming!'

'What do you mean?' said the king.

'Oh, sire!' panted the messenger, 'fly at once, there is no time to
lose. Foremost of the enemy rides a mad giant at a furious gallop. He
flourishes a tree for a club and is wild with anger, for as he goes he
cries, ""You wait till I get hold of you! I'll skin you alive! I'll wring
your neck! I'll break every bone in your body!"" Others ride behind, and
you will do well to retire before this whirlwind of destruction comes
upon you.'",8,career,is a,occupation,What is career?,A person's occupation.
moti,12,"Just then out of a cloud of dust in the distance the king saw Moti
approaching at a hard gallop, looking indeed like a giant compared with
the little beast he rode, whirling his castor-oil plant, which in the
distance might have been an oak tree, and the sound of his revilings and
shoutings came down upon the breeze! Behind him the dust cloud moved
to the sound of the thunder of hoofs, whilst here and there flashed the
glitter of steel. The sight and the sound struck terror into the king,
and, turning his horse, he fled at top speed, thinking that a regiment
of yelling giants was upon him; and all his force followed him as fast
as they might go. One fat officer alone could not keep up on foot with
that mad rush, and as Moti came galloping up he flung himself on the
ground in abject fear. This was too much for Moti's excited pony, who
shied so suddenly that Moti went flying over his head like a sky rocket,
and alighted right on the top of his fat foe.

Quickly regaining his feet Moti began to swing his plant round his head
and to shout:

'Where are your men? Bring them up and I'll kill them. My regiments!
Come on, the whole lot of you! Where's your king? Bring him to me. Here
are all my fine fellows coming up and we'll each pull up a tree by the
roots and lay you all flat and your houses and towns and everything
else! Come on!'",107,flee,has subevent,run,What is flee?,To run away.
moti,13,"But the poor fat officer could do nothing but squat on his knees with
his hands together, gasping. At last, when he got his breath, Moti sent
him off to bring his king, and to tell him that if he was reasonable his
life should be spared. Off the poor man went, and by the time the troops
of Moti's side had come up and arranged themselves to look as formidable
as possible, he returned with his king. The latter was very humble and
apologetic, and promised never to make war any more, to pay a large sum
of money, and altogether do whatever his conqueror wished.

So the armies on both sides went rejoicing home, and this was really
the making of the fortune of clumsy Moti, who lived long and contrived
always to be looked up to as a fountain of wisdom, valour, and
discretion by all except his relations, who could never understand what
he had done to be considered so much wiser than anyone else.",157,fountain,is used for,decoration,What is the fountain built for?,Decoration.

Now he had no time to attend to the cattle any longer, but drove them straight home. Then he went into the stable, led out a horse, sold it, and bought seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes with the money. He made the thole-pins out of the iron, put on his iron shoes, and set forth. For a time he traveled by land. At last he came to the lake which he had to cross. He saw nothing but water before and behind him, and rowing so long and steadily that he wore out one thole-pin after another. He at length reached land, and a green meadow, where no trees grew. He walked all around the meadow, and at last found a mound of earth from which smoke was rising. When he looked more closely, out came a woman who was nine yards long.

He had not gone far when he came to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa. No sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent-dragon. Its body was so big that it looked like the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the whole width of the bridge.

Hidesato knew at once that this was no ordinary mortal and he wondered much at the strange occurrence. Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?

So Hidesato was conducted to the palace of the Dragon King, under the bridge. Strange to say, as he followed his host downwards the waters parted to let them pass, and his clothes did not even feel damp as he passed through the flood. Never had Hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake. He had often heard of the Sea King's palace at the bottom of the sea, where all the servants and retainers were salt-water fishes, but here was a magnificent building in the heart of Lake Biwa.

Thus the hours flew by till midnight, and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede.

Hidesato looked where his host pointed, and, in the dim light of the starlit evening, behind the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an enormous centipede winding round the mountains, and the light in its hundred feet glowed like so many distant lanterns moving slowly towards the shore.

Nothing daunted, Hidesato took another arrow, fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly. Again the arrow hit the mark, it struck the centipede right in the middle of its head, only to glance off and fall to the ground. The centipede was invulnerable to weapons!

Stooping to pick it up he found that it was one of the ogre's huge arms which he must have slashed off in the fight.

He felt sure that one day or other, as soon as the ogre got over his scare, he would come to try to get his arm back again.

awaiting him.

child with them, so that no one will be left at home. They will be sure
to lay the child in the shade behind the hedge while they are at work;
you must lie by its side, just as if you were watching it. Then I will
come out of the wood and steal away the child; you must rush after me,
as if to save it from me. Then I must let it fall, and you must bring it

off together, the poor thing went limping along, holding her tail up in
the air. The wolf and his second were already on the spot; when they saw
their antagonists coming, and caught sight of the elevated tail of the
cat, they thought it was a sabre they were bringing with them. And as
the poor thing came limping on three legs, they supposed it was lifting
a big stone to throw at them. This frightened them very much; the wild
boar crept among the leaves, and the wolf clambered up into a tree. And
when the dog and cat came up, they were surprised not to see any one
there. However, the wild boar was not perfectly hidden in the leaves,

She was a great admirer of romantic places, and spent much of her time
with the flowers and winds and clouds in the open air. Though the flower
were homely, if it was fragrant--though the wind were rough, if it was
healthful--and though the cloud were dark, if it embosomed the fruitful
rain, she knew how, in spite of appearances, to acknowledge the good

called Osseo, who was scarcely able to walk, and who was too poor to
have things like others. The only property he owned in the world was the
walking-staff which he carried in his hand. Though thus poor and homely,
Osseo was a devout and good man; faithful in all his duties, and
obedient in all things to the Good Spirit. Of course they jeered and
laughed at Oweenee on all sides, but she seemed to be quite happy, and

owner of the big woods, or the great timber-man.

steps of my husband, it is more precious to me than all the forests of
the north.""

A time came when the sisters, and their husbands, and their parents were

smiled upon Osseo, and kept with him by the way the same as if he had
been the comeliest bridegroom in all the company. Osseo often stopped
and gazed upward; but they could perceive nothing in the direction in
which he looked, unless it was the faint glimmering of the evening star.
They heard him muttering to himself as they went along, and one of the
elder sisters caught the words, ""Pity me, my father!""

is that he would not fall and break his neck, that our sister might have

and feeble woman, bent almost double, and walking with the staff which
he had cast aside.

as he had before. So he went along its length, ""for sooner or later I
will come to the end of it,"" thought he.

As he went along he again struck against something, and when he felt it,
it was again something cold, and large and slippery.

circle, and that the crooked one had coiled himself about the herdsman's
cottage. At these words the crooked one moved a little to one side, so
that Per Gynt could get into the cottage. When he entered he found it as
dark inside as it was out. He stumbled and felt his way along the
walls. He wanted to lay aside his firelock and his hunting-bag. But
while he was feeling his way about, he once more noticed the something
large, and cold and slippery.

""And who are you now?"" cried Per Gynt.

""O, I am the big crooked one,"" was the answer. And no matter where he
took hold or where he set his foot, he could feel the coils of the
crooked one laid around him.

""This is a poor place to be in,"" thought Per Gynt, ""for this crooked one
is outside and inside. I will soon put what is wrong to rights."" He
took his firelock, went out again, and felt his way along the crooked
one until he came to his head.",51,crooked,is the antonym of,straight,What is the antonym of crooked?,Straight.

Per Gynt did not waste any time, but shot three bullets right through
the middle of his head.

""Shoot again!"" cried the crooked one. But Per Gynt knew better, for had
he shot another time, the bullet would have rebounded and hit him. When
this had been done, Per Gynt and his dogs took hold of the great troll,
and dragged him out of the hut, so that they might make themselves
comfortable there. And meanwhile the hills about rang with laughter and

per-gynt,5,"In the morning Per Gynt went out hunting. When he had made his way
far into the Fjoll, he saw a girl driving sheep and goats across a
mountain-top. But when he reached the top of the mountain, the girl
had vanished, as well as her flock, and all he saw was a great pack
of bears.

""Never yet have I seen bears run together in packs,"" thought Per Gynt.
But when he came nearer, they all disappeared save one alone. Then a
voice called from a nearby hill:

      ""Guard your boar, for understand,

The hills rang with echoing laughter:

""You should have guarded your boar better,"" called one voice.

""I did not think he carried the wash-bowl in his mouth,"" answered the
other.

Per Gynt skinned the bear, and buried his body among the bowlders; but
the head and skin he took with him. On the way back he met a mountain
fox.

see how high Per Gynt carries his firelock!"" sounded from another, as
Per Gynt shouldered his firelock and shot the fox. He also skinned,
and took the skin with him. When he reached the herdsman's hut, he
nailed the heads, with jaws wide open, against the outer wall. Then he
made a fire and hung a soup kettle over it. It smoked so terribly he
could hardly keep his eyes open, and therefore had to make a loop-hole.

poured the whole kettleful of soup over his nose. The troll rushed off
lamenting loudly. From all the heights around came laughter and
derision and calls of:

""Gyri Soupsmeller, Gyri Soupsmeller!""

Thereupon all was quiet for a time. Before very long the noise and
tumult outside began again. Per Gynt looked out, and saw a wagon drawn
by bears. The great troll was loaded upon it, and off they went with
him up the Fjoll. Suddenly a pail of water was poured down through
the chimney, smothering the fire, and Per Gynt sat in the dark. Then
laughter and jibes came from every corner, and one voice said: ""Now Per

pack of wolves, of whom he shot some and clubbed the others to death.
When he reached the hut at Val, he found it pitch dark there, and there
was no fire to be seen, far or near. But there were four strangers in
the hut, who were frightening the dairy-maids. They were four mountain
trolls, and their names were: Gust i Vore, Tron Valfjeldet, Kjostol

But Per Gynt thought he could manage to clear the house of the trolls.
So they told him to stay, and gave him a pig's skin into the bargain.
Then the bear lay down behind the hearth, Per took out his awl, his
pitch and his wire, and set out to make a single large shoe out of the
pig's skin. And he drew a thick rope through it for a lace, so that he
could lace the whole shoe together, and besides he had two wagon-spokes
for wedges at hand. Suddenly the trolls came along with fiddles and
fiddlers, and some of them danced, and others ate of the Christmas
dinner that stood on the table, and some fried bacon, and others fried
frogs and toads and disgusting things of that kind--the Christmas dinner
they had brought along themselves. In the meantime some of them noticed
the shoe Per Gynt had made. Since it was evidently intended for a large
foot, all the trolls wanted to try it on. When every one of them had
thrust in his foot, Per Gynt laced it, forced in a wedge, and then drew
the lace so taut that every last one of them was caught and held in the
shoe. But now the bear thrust forth his nose, and sniffed the roast.",147,fiddle,is a,another_name_for_violin,What is fiddle?,Fiddle is another name for violin.

that he rushed on the trolls, raining blows on every side and scratching
them. And Per Gynt hewed into the crowd with his other wagon-spoke as
though he meant to break their skulls. Then the trolls had to make
themselves scarce, but Per Gynt remained, and feasted on the Christmas

But at the time this story begins they had both been so careless and idle that their masters declared they would keep them no longer. So home they went to their mother and youngest brother, of whom they thought little, because he made himself useful about the house, and looked after the hens, and milked the cow.

But she repented bitterly of her words when Pinkel told her that he too was old enough to go out into the world, and that when he had made a fortune he would send for his mother to keep house for him. The widow wept many tears at parting from her youngest son, but as she saw that his heart was set upon going with his brothers, she did not try to keep him.

Nobody seemed to want them, or, if they did, the young men declared that they were not able to undertake all that the farmers or millers or woodcutters required of them. The youngest brother, who was wiser, would gladly have done some of the work that the others refused, but he was small and slight, and no one thought of offering him any. Therefore they went from one place to another, living only on the fruit and nuts they could find in the woods, and getting hungrier every day. One night, after they had been walking for many hours and were very tired, they came to a large lake with an island in the middle of it. From the island streamed a strong light, by which they could see everything almost as clearly as if the sun had been shining, and they perceived that, lying half hidden in the rushes, was a boat.",182,boat,is used for,sailing,Which means of transportation do we use when sailing?,Boat.

As they drew near the island they saw that it came from a golden lantern hanging over the door of a hut, while sweet tinkling music proceeded from some bells attached to the golden horns of a goat which was feeding near the cottage. The young men's hearts rejoiced as they thought that at last they would be able to rest their weary limbs, and they entered the hut, but were amazed to see an ugly old woman inside, wrapped in a cloak of gold which lighted up the whole house.

'You cannot get it here,' said the witch, 'but you will find both food and shelter in the palace on the other side of the lake. Take your boat and go; but leave this boy with me-I can find work for him, though something tells me he is quick and cunning, and will do me ill.'

'What harm can a poor boy like me do a great Troll like you?' answered Pinkel. 'Let me go, I pray you, with my brothers. I will promise never to hurt you.'

Now, at last, their luck seemed to have turned, for while the two eldest were given places in the king's stables, Pinkel was taken as page to the little prince.

It was late by the time he arrived, and almost dark, but he knew by the savoury smell that reached him that the witch was cooking her supper. So he climbed softly on to the roof, and, peering, watched till the old woman's back was turned, when he quickly drew a handful of salt from his pocket and threw it into the pot. Scarcely had he done this when the witch called her daughter and bade her lift the pot off the fire and put the stew into a dish, as it had been cooking quite long enough and she was hungry. But no sooner had she tasted it than she put her spoon down, and declared that her daughter must have been meddling with it, for it was impossible to eat anything that was all made of salt.",97,salt,is capable of,season_food,What can salt do?,It can season food.

'Well, then, take the lantern with you,' answered the witch, 'for supper I must have, and there is no water that is nearer.'

So the girl took her pail in one hand and the golden lantern in the other, and hastened away to the well, followed by Pinkel, who took care to keep out of the way of the rays.

'Is that you, Pinkel?' cried she; and the youth answered:

'Yes, dear mother, it is I!'

'And are you not a knave for robbing me?' said she.

'Truly, dear mother, I am,' replied Pinkel, rowing faster than ever, for he was half afraid that the witch might come after him. But she had no power on the water, and turned angrily into the hut, muttering to herself all the while:

'O cunning one,' cried he, 'what treasure hast thou brought me!'

At length they remembered the goat with golden horns and the bells, and they rejoiced; 'For,' said they, 'THIS time the old woman will be on the watch, and let him be as clever as he likes, the bells on the horns are sure to warn her.' So when, as before, the king came down to the stables and praised the cleverness of their brother, the young men told him of that other marvel possessed by the witch, the goat with the golden horns.

From this moment the king never closed his eyes at night for longing after this wonderful creature. He understood something of the danger that there might be in trying to steal it, now that the witch's suspicions were aroused, and he spent hours in making plans for outwitting her.

'I will fetch it myself,' answered Pinkel.

This time it was easier for Pinkel to approach the island unseen, as there was no golden lantern to thrown its beams over the water. But, on the other hand, the goat slept inside the hut, and would therefore have to be taken from under the very eyes of the old woman. How was he to do it? All the way across the lake he thought and thought, till at length a plan came into his head which seemed as if it might do, though he knew it would be very difficult to carry out.",24,bell,is used for,making_noise,What is a bell used for?,Making noises.

Then he crept up and fixed the wood under the door, which opened outwards, in such a manner that the more you tried to shut it the more firmly it stuck. And this was what happened when the girl went as usual to bolt the door and make all fast for the night.

'What are you doing?' asked the witch, as her daughter kept tugging at the handle.

Very soon they both might have been heard snoring, and Pinkel knew that his time was come. Slipping off his shoes he stole into the hut on tiptoe, and taking from his pocket some food of which the goat was particularly fond, he laid it under his nose. Then, while the animal was eating it, he stuffed each golden bell with wool which he had also brought with him, stopping every minute to listen, lest the witch should awaken, and he should find himself changed into some dreadful bird or beast. But the snoring still continued, and he went on with his work as quickly as he could. When the last bell was done he drew another handful of food out of his pocket, and held it out to the goat, which instantly rose to its feet and followed Pinkel, who backed slowly to the door, and directly he got outside he seized the goat in his arms and ran down to the place where he had moored his boat.",206,seize,has subevent,take,What is seize?,To deliberately take hold of.

'Yes, dear mother, it is I,' said Pinkel.

'Have you stolen my golden goat?' asked she.

'Yes, dear mother, I have,' answered Pinkel.

'Are you not a knave, Pinkel?'

'Yes, dear mother, I am,' he replied. And the old witch shouted in a rage:

'Ah! beware how you come hither again, for next time you shall not escape me!'

But Pinkel laughed and rowed on.

The king was so delighted with the goat that he always kept it by his side, night and day; and, as he had promised, Pinkel was made ruler over the third part of the kingdom.

'He will need to be clever if he is to steal that!' they cried, with a chuckle. And when next the king came to see his horses they began to speak of Pinkel and his marvellous cunning, and how he had contrived to steal the lantern and the goat, which nobody else would have been able to do.

'But as he was there, it is a pity he could not have brought away the golden cloak,' added they.

'The golden cloak! what is that?' asked the king. And the young men described its beauties in such glowing words that the king declared he should never know a day's happiness till he had wrapped the cloak round his own shoulders.

'And,' added he, 'the man who brings it to me shall wed my daughter, and shall inherit my throne.'

'None can get it save Pinkel,' said they; for they did not imagine that the witch, after two warnings, could allow their brother to escape a third time. So Pinkel was sent for, and with a glad heart he set out.",207,warning,is a,informing,What is a warning?,The action of informing the risk of doing something.
pinkel-thief,20,"He passed many hours inventing first one plan and then another, till he had a scheme ready which he thought might prove successful.

Thrusting a large bag inside his coat, he pushed off from the shore, taking care this time to reach the island in daylight. Having made his boat fast to a tree, he walked up to the hut, hanging his head, and putting on a face that was both sorrowful and ashamed.

'Is that you, Pinkel?' asked the witch when she saw him, her eyes gleaming savagely.

'Yes, dear mother, it is I,' answered Pinkel.

'So you have dared, after all you have done, to put yourself in my power!' cried she. 'Well, you sha'n't escape me THIS time!' And she took down a large knife and began to sharpen it.

'Then, if I must die,' said Pinkel, who, by this time, was getting really rather frightened, 'let me at least choose the manner of my death. I am very hungry, for I have had nothing to eat all day. Put some poison, if you like, into the porridge, but at least let me have a good meal before I die.'

'That is not a bad idea,' answered the woman; 'as long as you do die, it is all one to me.' And ladling out a large bowl of porridge, she stirred some poisonous herbs into it, and set about work that had to be done. Then Pinkel hastily poured all the contents of the bowl into his bag, and make a great noise with his spoon, as if he was scraping up the last morsel.

'Poisoned or not, the porridge is excellent. I have eaten it, every scrap; do give me some more,' said Pinkel, turning towards her.",195,spoon,is used for,eating,What is a spoon?,An implement for eating.

In an instant Pinkel again emptied the porridge into the bag, and the next minute he rolled on the floor, twisting himself about as if in agony, uttering loud groans the while. Suddenly he grew silent and lay still.",93,agony,is a,pain,What is agony?,Extreme pain.

What a trouble girls are!' And she went to the door to watch if there were any signs of her daughter. But nothing could be seen of her, and heavy rain was falling.

'It is no night for my cloak,' she muttered; 'it would be covered with mud by the time I got back.' So she took it off her shoulders and hung it carefully up in a cupboard in the room. After that she put on her clogs and started to seek her daughter.

She forgot all about her daughter, and ran down to the shore, screaming with rage at being outwitted a third time.

'Is that you, Pinkel?' cried she.

'Yes, dear mother, it is I.'

creatures in the world, and so kind-hearted that they could not bear
to see their subjects want for anything. The consequence was that
they gradually gave away all their treasures, till they positively
had nothing left to live upon; and this coming to the ears of their
neighbour, King Bruin, he promptly raised a large army and marched into
their country. The poor King, having no means of defending his kingdom,
was forced to disguise himself with a false beard, and carrying his only
son, the little Prince Featherhead, in his arms, and accompanied only by
the Queen, to make the best of his way into the wild country. They were
lucky enough to escape the soldiers of King Bruin, and at last, after
unheard-of fatigues and adventures, they found themselves in a charming
green valley, through which flowed a stream clear as crystal and
overshadowed by beautiful trees.",76,army,is a,military_force,What is an army?,"An army is a large, highly organized military force."

or two in his pocket, so he drew one out hastily, and the Queen lent him
her girdle to fasten it to, and it had hardly touched the water before
it caught a big fish, which made them an excellent meal--and not before
they needed it, for they had found nothing until then but a few wild
berries and roots. They thought that for the present they could not do
better than stay in this delightful place, and the King set to work, and
soon built a bower of branches to shelter them; and when it was finished
the Queen was so charmed with it that she declared nothing was lacking
to complete her happiness but a flock of sheep, which she and the little
Prince might tend while the King fished. They soon found that the fish
were not only abundant and easily caught, but also very beautiful, with
glittering scales of every imaginable hue; and before long the King
discovered that he could teach them to talk and whistle better than any
parrot.",102,berry,is a,fruit,What is a berry?,A berry is a small succulent fruit.

sell them; and as no one had ever before seen any like them the
people flocked about him eagerly and bought all he had caught, so that
presently not a house in the city was considered complete without a
crystal bowl full of fish, and the King's customers were very particular
about having them to match the rest of the furniture, and gave him a
vast amount of trouble in choosing them. However, the money he obtained
in this way enabled him to buy the Queen her flock of sheep, as well as
many of the other things which go to make life pleasant, so that they

of the Beech-Woods lived in the lovely valley to which chance had led
the poor fugitives, and it was she who had, in pity for their forlorn
condition, sent the King such good luck to his fishing, and generally
taken them under her protection. This she was all the more inclined to
do as she loved children, and little Prince Featherhead, who never
cried and grew prettier day by day, quite won her heart. She made the
acquaintance of the King and the Queen without at first letting them
know that she was a fairy, and they soon took a great fancy to her, and
even trusted her with the precious Prince, whom she carried off to her
palace, where she regaled him with cakes and tarts and every other
good thing. This was the way she chose of making him fond of her; but
afterwards, as he grew older, she spared no pains in educating and
training him as a prince should be trained. But unfortunately, in spite
of all her care, he grew so vain and frivolous that he quitted his
peaceful country life in disgust, and rushed eagerly after all the
foolish gaieties of the neighbouring town, where his handsome face and
charming manners speedily made him popular. The King and Queen deeply
regretted this alteration in their son, but did not know how to mend
matters, since the good old Fairy had made him so self-willed.",145,tart,is a,pie,What is a tart?,A tart is a small pie.

an old friend of hers called Saradine, who rushed into her house so
breathless with rage that she could hardly speak.

'Dear, dear! what is the matter?' said the Fairy of the Beech-Woods
soothingly.

'The matter!' cried Saradine. 'You shall soon hear all about it. You
know that, not content with endowing Celandine, Princess of the Summer
Islands, with everything she could desire to make her charming, I
actually took the trouble to bring her up myself; and now what does she
do but come to me with more coaxings and caresses than usual to beg a
favour. And what do you suppose this favour turns out to be--when I have

whenever I meet anybody. You see what a weariness my life will be to me
under these circumstances, and yet I assure you I am not ungrateful to
you for all your kindness!"" 'I did all I could,' continued Saradine, 'to
make her think better of it, but in vain; so after going through the
usual ceremony for taking back my gifts, I'm come to you for a little
peace and quietness. But, after all, I have not taken anything of
consequence from this provoking Celandine. Nature had already made her
so pretty, and given her such a ready wit of her own, that she will
do perfectly well without me. However, I thought she deserved a little
lesson, so to begin with I have whisked her off into the desert, and
there left her!'",212,desert,is a,dry_environment,What is a desert?,A desert is an area of dry environment filled with sand.

kind-hearted old Fairy. 'You had better hand her over to me. I don't
think so very badly of her after all. I'll just cure her vanity by
making her love someone better than herself. Really, when I come to
consider of it, I declare the little minx has shown more spirit and
originality in the matter than one expects of a princess.'

Saradine willingly consented to this arrangement, and the old Fairy's
first care was to smooth away all the difficulties which surrounded
the Princess, and lead her by the mossy path overhung with trees to the
bower of the King and Queen, who still pursued their peaceful life in
the valley.

They were immensely surprised at her appearance, but her charming face,
and the deplorably ragged condition to which the thorns and briers had
reduced her once elegant attire, speedily won their compassion; they
recognised her as a companion in misfortune, and the Queen welcomed
her heartily, and begged her to share their simple repast. Celandine
gracefully accepted their hospitality, and soon told them what had
happened to her. The King was charmed with her spirit, while the Queen
thought she had indeed been daring thus to go against the Fairy's
wishes.

shall be perfectly happy.'",165,reduce,is the antonym of,increase,What is the opposite of reduce?,Increase.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,8,"The King and Queen were only too delighted to have this charming
Princess to supply the place of Prince Featherhead, whom they saw
but seldom, since the Fairy had provided him with a palace in the
neighbouring town, where he lived in the greatest luxury, and did
nothing but amuse himself from morning to night. So Celandine stayed,
and helped the Queen to keep house, and very soon they loved her dearly.
When the Fairy of the Beech-Woods came to them, they presented the
Princess to her, and told her story, little thinking that the Fairy knew
more about Celandine than they did. The old Fairy was equally delighted
with her, and often invited her to visit her Leafy Palace, which was
the most enchanting place that could be imagined, and full of treasures.
Often she would say to the Princess, when showing her some wonderful
thing:",53,amuse,has subevent,entertain,What does it mean to amuse?,To amuse means to entertain in a pleasant manner.

thinking that it was to her that the Fairy meant to give the two blue
wax-torches which burned without ever getting smaller, or the diamond
from which more diamonds were continually growing, or the boat that
sailed under water, or whatever beautiful or wonderful thing they might
happen to be looking at. It is true that she never said so positively,
but she certainly allowed the Princess to believe it, because she
thought a little disappointment would be good for her. But the person
she really relied upon for curing Celandine of her vanity was Prince
Featherhead. The old Fairy was not at all pleased with the way he had
been going on for some time, but her heart was so soft towards him that
she was unwilling to take him away from the pleasures he loved, except
by offering him something better, which is not the most effectual mode
of correction, though it is without doubt the most agreeable.",52,boat,is used for,travel,What do we use boats for?,We use boats to travel on water.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,10,"However, she did not even hint to the Princess that Featherhead was
anything but absolutely perfect, and talked of him so much that when at
last she announced that he was coming to visit her, Celandine made up
her mind that this delightful Prince would be certain to fall in love
with her at once, and was quite pleased at the idea. The old Fairy
thought so too, but as this was not at all what she wished, she took
care to throw such an enchantment over the Princess that she appeared to
Featherhead quite ugly and awkward, though to every one else she looked
just as usual. So when he arrived at the Leafy Palace, more handsome and
fascinating even than ever she had been led to expect, he hardly so much
as glanced at the Princess, but bestowed all his attention upon the old
Fairy, to whom he seemed to have a hundred things to say. The Princess
was immensely astonished at his indifference, and put on a cold and
offended air, which, however, he did not seem to observe. Then as a last
resource she exerted all her wit and gaiety to amuse him, but with no
better success, for he was of an age to be more attracted by beauty
than by anything else, and though he responded politely enough, it
was evident that his thoughts were elsewhere.",212,gaiety,is a,happiness,What is gaiety?,Gaiety is the atmosphere of happiness.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,11,"Celandine was deeply
mortified, since for her part the Prince pleased her very well, and
for the first time she bitterly regretted the fairy gifts she had been
anxious to get rid of. Prince Featherhead was almost equally puzzled,
for he had heard nothing from the King and Queen but the praises of this
charming Princess, and the fact that they had spoken of her as so very
beautiful only confirmed his opinion that people who live in the country
have no taste. He talked to them of his charming acquaintances in the
town, the beauties he had admired, did admire, or thought he was going
to admire, until Celandine, who heard it all, was ready to cry with
vexation. The Fairy too was quite shocked at his conceit, and hit upon
a plan for curing him of it. She sent to him by an unknown messenger a
portrait of Princess Celandine as she really was, with this inscription:
'All this beauty and sweetness, with a loving heart and a great kingdom,
might have been yours but for your well-known fickleness.'",3,mortify,is the antonym of,dignify,What is the opposite of mortify?,Dignify.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,12,"This message made a great impression upon the Prince, but not so much
as the portrait. He positively could not tear his eyes away from it, and
exclaimed aloud that never, never had he seen anything so lovely and
so graceful. Then he began to think that it was too absurd that he, the
fascinating Featherhead, should fall in love with a portrait; and, to
drive away the recollections of its haunting eyes, he rushed back to
the town; but somehow everything seemed changed. The beauties no longer
pleased him, their witty speeches had ceased to amuse; and indeed, for
their parts, they found the Prince far less amiable than of yore, and
were not sorry when he declared that, after all, a country life suited
him best, and went back to the Leafy Palace.",124,amiable,is a,friendly,What does it mean to be amiable?,To be amiable means to be friendly.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,13,"Meanwhile, the Princess Celandine had been finding the time pass but slowly with the King and
Queen, and was only too pleased when Featherhead reappeared. She at once
noticed the change in him, and was deeply curious to find the reason of
it. Far from avoiding her, he now sought her company and seemed to take
pleasure in talking to her, and yet the Princess did not for a moment
flatter herself with the idea that he was in love with her, though it
did not take her long to decide that he certainly loved someone. But one
day the Princess, wandering sadly by the river, spied Prince Featherhead
fast asleep in the shade of a tree, and stole nearer to enjoy the
delight of gazing at his dear face unobserved. Judge of her astonishment
when she saw that he was holding in his hand a portrait of herself!
In vain did she puzzle over the apparent contradictoriness of his
behaviour. Why did he cherish her portrait while he was so fatally
indifferent to herself? At last she found an opportunity of asking him
the name of the Princess whose picture he carried about with him always.

'Alas! how can I tell you?' replied he.",179,cherish,is the antonym of,despise,What is the opposite of cherish?,Despise.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,14,"'Why should you not?' said the Princess timidly. 'Surely there is
nothing to prevent you.'

'Nothing to prevent me!' repeated he, 'when my utmost efforts have
failed to discover the lovely original. Should I be so sad if I could
but find her? But I do not even know her name.'

More surprised than ever, the Princess asked to be allowed to see
the portrait, and after examining it for a few minutes returned it,
remarking shyly that at least the original had every cause to be
satisfied with it.

'That means that you consider it flattered,' said the Prince severely.
'Really, Celandine, I thought better of you, and should have expected
you to be above such contemptible jealousy. But all women are alike!'

'Indeed, I meant only that it was a good likeness,' said the Princess
meekly.

'Then you know the original,' cried the Prince, throwing himself on his
knees beside her. 'Pray tell me at once who it is, and don't keep me in
suspense!'

'Oh! don't you see that it is meant for me?' cried Celandine.

The Prince sprang to his feet, hardly able to refrain from telling her
that she must be blinded by vanity to suppose she resembled the lovely
portrait even in the slightest degree; and after gazing at her for an
instant with icy surprise, turned and left her without another word, and
in a few hours quitted the Leafy Palace altogether.",86,minute,is part of,hour,How many minutes equals an hour?,Sixty.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,15,"Now the Princess was indeed unhappy, and could no longer bear to stay
in a place where she had been so cruelly disdained. So, without even
bidding farewell to the King and Queen, she left the valley behind her,
and wandered sadly away, not caring whither. After walking until she
was weary, she saw before her a tiny house, and turned her slow steps
towards it. The nearer she approached the more miserable it appeared,
and at length she saw a little old woman sitting upon the door-step, who
said grimly:

'Here comes one of these fine beggars who are too idle to do anything
but run about the country!'

'Alas! madam,' said Celandine, with tears in her pretty eyes, 'a sad
fate forces me to ask you for shelter.'",79,approach,has subevent,advance,What does it mean to approach?,To approach means to advance nearer.

our way. Upon my word, if I could be sure of finding some one every
day whose head was as soft as his heart, I wouldn't wish for a more
agreeable life myself! But I have worked hard to build my house and
secure a morsel to eat, and I suppose you think that I am to give away
everything to the first passer-by who chooses to ask for it. Not at all!
I wager that a fine lady like you has more money than I have. I must
search her, and see if it is not so,' she added, hobbling towards
Celandine with the aid of her stick.

'Alas! madam,' replied the Princess, 'I only wish I had. I would give it
to you with all the pleasure in life.'

continued the old woman.",23,supper,is a,meal,What is supper?,Supper is the last meal of the day.

seem to have come to bring me anything. But what is it that you do want?
Shelter? Well, that does not cost much; but after that comes supper, and
that I can't hear of. Oh dear no! Why, at your age one is always ready
to eat; and now you have been walking, and I suppose you are ravenous?'

'Indeed no, madam,' answered the poor Princess, 'I am too sad to be
hungry.'

'Oh, well! if you will promise to go on being sad, you may stay for the
night,' said the old woman mockingly.

There upon she made the Princess sit down beside her, and began fingering
her silken robe, while she muttered 'Lace on top, lace underneath! This
must have cost you a pretty penny! It would have been better to save
enough to feed yourself, and not come begging to those who want all
they have for themselves. Pray, what may you have paid for these fine
clothes?'",175,robe,is a,garment,What is a robe?,A robe is a long loose outer garment.

'What do you know, if I may ask?' said the old dame.

'Not much; but indeed I am very unhappy,' cried Celandine, bursting into
tears, 'and if my services are any good to you--'

'Services!' interrupted the hag crossly. 'One has to pay for services,
and I am not above doing my own work.'

'Madam, I will serve you for nothing,' said the poor Princess, whose
spirits were sinking lower and lower. 'I will do anything you please;
all I wish is to live quietly in this lonely spot.'",135,lonely,causes,meet_friend,What do people do when they feel lonely?,People meet with friends when they feel lonely.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,19,"'Oh! I know you are only trying to take me in,' answered she; 'and if
I do let you serve me, is it fitting that you should be so much better
dressed I am? If I keep you, will you give me your clothes and wear some
that I will provide you with? It is true that I am getting old and may
want someone to take care of me some day.'

'Oh! for pity's sake, do what you please with my clothes,' cried poor
Celandine miserably.

And the old woman hobbled off with great alacrity, and fetched a little
bundle containing a wretched dress, such as the Princess had never even
seen before, and nimbly skipped round, helping her to put it on instead
of her own rich robe, with many exclamations of:

'Saints!--what a magnificent lining! And the width of it! It will make
me four dresses at least. Why, child, I wonder you could walk under such
a weight, and certainly in my house you would not have had room to turn
round.'

So saying, she folded up the robe, and put it by with great care, while
she remarked to Celandine:

'That dress of mine certainly suits you to a marvel; be sure you take
great care of it.'

When supper-time came she went into the house, declining all the
Princess's offers of assistance, and shortly afterwards brought out a
very small dish, saying:

'Now let us sup.'",241,marvel,is a,surprise,What is a marvel?,A marvel is something that causes surprises.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,20,"Whereupon she handed Celandine a small piece of black bread and
uncovered the dish, which contained two dried plums.

'We will have one between us,' continued the old dame; 'and as you are
the visitor, you shall have the half which contains the stone; but be
very careful that you don't swallow it, for I keep them against the
winter, and you have no idea what a good fire they make. Now, you take
my advice--which won't cost you anything--and remember that it is always
more economical to buy fruit with stones on this account.'

Celandine, absorbed in her own sad thoughts, did not even hear this
prudent counsel, and quite forgot to eat her share of the plum, which
delighted the old woman, who put it by carefully for her breakfast,
saying:",19,plum,is a,edible_fruit,What is a plum?,A plum is an edible fruit.

don't generally know. For instance, look at my house! It is built
entirely of the seeds of all the pears I have eaten in my life. Now,
most people throw them away, and that only shows what a number of things
are wasted for want of a little patience and ingenuity.'

But Celandine did not find it possible to be interested in this and
similar pieces of advice. And the old woman soon sent her to bed, for
fear the night air might give her an appetite. She passed a sleepless
night; but in the morning the old dame remarked:

'I heard how well you slept. After such a night you cannot want any
breakfast; so while I do my household tasks you had better stay in bed,
since the more one sleeps the less one need eat; and as it is market-day
I will go to town and buy a pennyworth of bread for the week's eating.'",54,seed,is capable of,become_plant,What happens to seeds when they are planted?,They become plants.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,22,"And so she chattered on, but poor Celandine did not hear or heed her;
she wandered out into the desolate country to think over her sad fate.
However, the good Fairy of the Beech-Woods did not want her to be
starved, so she sent her an unlooked for relief in the shape of a
beautiful white cow, which followed her back to the tiny house. When the
old woman saw it her joy knew no bounds.

'Now we can have milk and cheese and butter!' cried she. 'Ah! how good
milk is! What a pity it is so ruinously expensive!' So they made a
little shelter of branches for the beautiful creature which was quite
gentle, and followed Celandine about like a dog when she took it out
every day to graze.",61,cow,is used for,milking,Why do we raise cows on a farm?,We raise cows for milking.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,23,"One morning as she sat by a little brook, thinking
sadly, she suddenly saw a young stranger approaching, and got up
quickly, intending to avoid him. But Prince Featherhead, for it was
he, perceiving her at the same moment, rushed towards her with every
demonstration of joy: for he had recognised her, not as the Celandine
whom he had slighted, but as the lovely Princess whom he had sought
vainly for so long. The fact was that the Fairy of the Beech-Woods,
thinking she had been punished enough, had withdrawn the enchantment
from her, and transferred it to Featherhead, thereby in an instant
depriving him of the good looks which had done so much towards making
him the fickle creature he was. Throwing himself down at the Princess's
feet, he implored her to stay, and at least speak to him, and she at
last consented, but only because he seemed to wish it so very much.
After that he came every day in the hope of meeting her again, and often
expressed his delight at being with her. But one day, when he had been
begging Celandine to love him, she confided to him that it was quite
impossible, since her heart was already entirely occupied by another.",196,delight,is a,pleasure,What is delight?,Delight is joy or pleasure.
prince-featherhead-and-the-princess-celandine,24,"'I have,' said she, 'the unhappiness of loving a Prince who is fickle,
frivolous, proud, incapable of caring for anyone but himself, who has
been spoilt by flattery, and, to crown all, who does not love me.'

'But,' cried Prince Featherhead, 'surely you cannot care for so
contemptible and worthless a creature as that.'

'Alas! but I do care,' answered the Princess, weeping.

'But where can his eyes be,' said the Prince, 'that your beauty makes no
impression upon him? As for me, since I have possessed your portrait I
have wandered over the whole world to find you, and, now we have met,
I see that you are ten times lovelier than I could have imagined, and I
would give all I own to win your love.'",115,possess,has subevent,have,What does it mean to possess?,To possess means to have something as an owner.

that Prince Featherhead can have parted with it?'

'He would part with his life sooner, lovely Princess,' answered he; 'I
can assure you of that, for I am Prince Featherhead.'

At the same moment the Fairy of the Beech-Woods took away the
enchantment, and the happy Princess recognised her lover, now truly
hers, for the trials they had both undergone had so changed and improved
them that they were capable of a real love for each other. You may
imagine how perfectly happy they were, and how much they had to hear and
to tell. But at length it was time to go back to the little house, and
as they went along Celandine remembered for the first time what a ragged
old dress she was wearing, and what an odd appearance she must present.

girl you may be sure that a young man will appear before long! But don't
imagine that I'm going to have you here--not a bit of it, be off with
you, my fine fellow!'

Prince Featherhead was inclined to be angry at this uncivil reception,
but he was really too happy to care much, so he only demanded, on
Celandine's behalf, that the old dame should give her back her own
attire, that she might go away suitably dressed.

This request roused her to fury, since she had counted upon the
Princess's fine robes to clothe her for the rest of her life, so that it
was some time before the Prince could make himself heard to explain that
he was willing to pay for them.",117,fury,is a,anger,What is fury?,Fury is extreme anger.

somewhat mollified her, however, and after making them both promise
faithfully that on no consideration would they ask for the gold back
again, she took the Princess into the house and grudgingly doled out
to her just enough of her gay attire to make her presentable, while the
rest she pretended to have lost. After this they found that they were
very hungry, for one cannot live on love, any more than on air, and then
the old woman's lamentations were louder than before. 'What!' she cried,
'feed people who were as happy as all that! Why, it was simply ruinous!'

But as the Prince began to look angry, she, with many sighs and
mutterings, brought out a morsel of bread, a bowl of milk, and six
plums, with which the lovers were well content: for as long as they
could look at one another they really did not know what they
were eating. It seemed as if they would go on for ever with their
reminiscences, the Prince telling how he had wandered all over the world
from beauty to beauty, always to be disappointed when he found that no
one resembled the portrait; the Princess wondering how it was he could
have been so long with her and yet never have recognised her, and over
and over again pardoning him for his cold and haughty behaviour to her.",200,reminiscence,is a,memory,What is reminiscence?,Reminiscence is an act of recalling memories from a long time ago.

everything right! But we cannot stay here,' she added; 'what are we to
do?'

The Prince thought they had better find their way to the Fairy of the
Beech-Woods and put themselves once more under her protection, and they
had hardly agreed upon this course when two little chariots wreathed
with jasmine and honeysuckle suddenly appeared, and, stepping into them,
they were whirled away to the Leafy Palace. Just before they lost sight
of the little house they heard loud cries and lamentations from the
miserly old dame, and, looking round, perceived that the beautiful cow
was vanishing in spite of her frantic efforts to hold it fast. And they
afterwards heard that she spent the rest of her life in trying to put
the handful of gold the Prince had thrown to her into her money-bag. For
the Fairy, as a punishment for her avarice, caused it to slip out again
as fast as she dropped it in.",74,chariot,is a,horse_drawn_vehicle,What is a chariot?,A chariot is a two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle.

could, with a clear conscience, begin to spoil them again. Very soon
the Fairy Saradine also arrived, bringing the King and Queen with her.
Princess Celandine implored her pardon, which she graciously gave;
indeed the Princess was so charming she could refuse her nothing. She
also restored to her the Summer Islands, and promised her protection
in all things. The Fairy of the Beech-Woods then informed the King and
Queen that their subjects had chased King Bruin from the throne, and
were waiting to welcome them back again; but they at once abdicated in
favour of Prince Featherhead, declaring that nothing could induce them
to forsake their peaceful life, and the Fairies undertook to see the
Prince and Princess established in their beautiful kingdoms. Their
marriage took place the next day, and they lived happily ever
afterwards, for Celandine was never vain and Featherhead was never
fickle any more.",116,throne,is a,special_kind_of_chair,What is a throne?,A throne is a special kind of chair that only rulers can sit on.

She said nothing, however, but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens, and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground.

'Oh, I have let fall my bran!' cried she; 'please get down and pick it up for me.' But Jose only answered:

'We shall find plenty of bran where we are going.' And the horse galloped on.

They were now passing through a forest, and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards, so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree.

'Dear me; how stupid! I have let my handkerchief blow away,' said she. 'Will you climb up and get it for me?' But Jose answered:

'We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going.' And the horse galloped on.

'Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later,' observed the horse; 'but mount again, as we have far to go.'

But it chanced one day that he could rouse no game, although he had tried in every direction since morning. And then, when evening was coming on, and he was about to ride home, he saw a dwarf or wild man running through the forest before him. The king at once spurred on his horse, rode after the dwarf, seized him and he was surprised at his strange appearance; for he was small and ugly, like a troll, and his hair was as stiff as bean-straw. But no matter what the king said to him, he would return no answer, nor say a single word one way or another.

When everything was completed the king had the wild man led up, placed in the small house, and he himself took and kept the key.

This seemed a merry game to the little fellow: he threw the apple in again, and the wild man threw it out again, and thus they played for a long time.

And when he did reach shore his first question was whether the wild man had been well guarded. Then the queen had to confess how matters stood, and told him how everything had happened. But the king was enraged beyond measure, and said he would punish the malefactor, no matter who he might be. And he ordered a great investigation at his court, and every human being in it had to testify. But no one knew anything. At last the little prince also had to come forward. And as he stood before the king he said: ""I know that I have deserved my father's anger; yet I cannot hide the truth; for I let out the wild man."" Then the queen turned white, and the others as well, for there was not one who was not fond of the prince. At last the king spoke: ""Never shall it be said of me that I was false to my vow, even for the sake of my own flesh and blood! No, you must die the death you have deserved.""

The other serving-men thought that he spoke wisely, so they bought a pig from the swine-herd, led it into the wood, butchered it and took its heart.

And as he sat in the very top of its crown, and looked about on every side, he saw a large and splendid royal castle rising in the distance, and gleaming in the sun. Then he grew very happy and at once set forth in that direction. On the way he met a farm-hand who was ploughing, and begged him to change clothes with him, which he did. Thus fitted out he at last reached the king's castle, went in, asked for a place, and was taken on as a herdsman, to tend the king's cattle.

Now when the princess had completed her fifteenth year, a quite unheard of swarm of suitors made their appearance, as may well be imagined; and for all that she said no to all of them, they only increased in number. At last the princess said: ""None other shall win me save he who can ride up the high Glass Mountain in full armor!"" The king thought this a good suggestion.

Just below the foot of the hill all the suitors assembled with splendid horses and glittering armor, that shone like fire in the sun, and from round about the people flocked together in great crowds to watch their tilting. And when everything was ready, the signal was given by horns and trumpets, and then the suitors, one after another, raced up the mountain with all their might. But the mountain was high, as slippery as ice, and besides it was steep beyond all measure. Not one of the suitors rode up more than a little way, before he tumbled down again, head over heels, and it might well happen that arms and legs were broken in the process.

For it had occurred to him how gladly he would have fared forth with the rest. Suddenly he heard footsteps and when he looked up, the wild man was standing before him. ""Thank you for the last time!"" said he, ""and why do you sit here so lonely and full of sorrow?"" ""Well,"" said the prince, ""I have no choice but to be sad and joyless.

Right beside it stood a splendid steed, saddled and bridled, pawing the earth with his steel hoofs, and champing his bit till the white foam dropped to the ground.

He was clad in steel from head to foot, with helmet on head, sword in belt and shield on arm, and he sat his horse with such knightly grace that it was a pleasure to look at him. At once all eyes were turned to the strange knight, and all asked who he might be; for none had ever seen him before. Yet they had had but little time to talk and question, for no sooner had he cleared the wood, than he rose in his stirrups, gave his horse the spurs, and shot forward like an arrow straight up the Glass Mountain. Yet he did not ride up all the way; but when he had reached the middle of the steep ascent, he suddenly flung around his steed and rode down again, so that the sparks flew from his horse's hoofs. Then he disappeared in the wood like a bird in flight. One may imagine the excitement which now seized upon all the people, and there was not one who did not admire the strange knight.

They then separated, the monkey going home to his forest trees and the crab to his stones along the river-side.

Each year it grew bigger, till at last it blossomed one spring, and in the following autumn bore some fine large persimmons. Among the broad smooth green leaves the fruit hung like golden balls, and as they ripened they mellowed to a deep orange. It was the little crab's pleasure to go out day by day and sit in the sun and put out his long eyes in the same way as a snail puts out its horn, and watch the persimmons ripening to perfection.",34,blossom,is a,flower,What blossoms in spring?,Flowers.

At last, one day, he knew the persimmons must be quite ripe and he wanted very much to taste one. He made several attempts to climb the tree, in the vain hope of reaching one of the beautiful persimmons hanging above him; but he failed each time, for a crab's legs are not made for climbing trees but only for running along the ground and over stones, both of which he can do most cleverly. In his dilemma he thought of his old playmate the monkey, who, he knew, could climb trees better than any one else in the world. He determined to ask the monkey to help him, and set out to find him.",41,attempt,is a,activity,What is the activity of trying?,Attempt.

He was soon wide awake, however, when he heard himself called, and eagerly listening to what the crab told him. When he heard that the seed which he had long ago exchanged for a rice-dumpling had grown into a tree and was now bearing good fruit, he was delighted, for he at once devised a cunning plan which would give him all the persimmons for himself.",26,nap,has subevent,sleep,What is a nap?,"A short period of sleep, especially during the day."

He quickly climbed the tree and began to pluck and eat, as fast as he could, one persimmon after another. Each time he chose the best and ripest he could find, and went on eating till he could eat no more. Not one would he give to the poor hungry crab waiting below, and when he had finished there was little but the hard, unripe fruit left.",1,consent,is a,permission,How to consent?,By giving permissions.

He was so disappointed that he ran round and round the tree calling to the monkey to remember his promise. The monkey at first took no notice of the crab's complaints, but at last he picked out the hardest, greenest persimmon he could find and aimed it at the crab's head. The persimmon is as hard as stone when it is unripe. The monkey's missile struck home and the crab was sorely hurt by the blow. Again and again, as fast as he could pick them, the monkey pulled off the hard persimmons and threw them at the defenseless crab till he dropped dead, covered with wounds all over his body.

Now the crab had a son who had been playing with a friend not far from the spot where this sad work had taken place. On the way home he came across his father dead, in a most dreadful condition-his head was smashed and his shell broken in several places, and around his body lay the unripe persimmons which had done their deadly work. At this dreadful sight the poor young crab sat down and wept.",82,shell,is at location of,ocean,Where can shells be found?,In the ocean.

He looked about for some clue which would lead him to discover the murderer. Looking up at the tree he noticed that the best fruit had gone, and that all around lay bits of peel and numerous seeds strewn on the ground as well as the unripe persimmons which had evidently been thrown at his father. Then he understood that the monkey was the murderer, for he now remembered that his father had once told him the story of the rice-dumpling and the persimmon-seed. The young crab knew that monkeys liked persimmons above all other fruit, and he felt sure that his greed for the coveted fruit had been the cause of the old crab's death.

He warned him that he must be very careful in what he did, for the monkey was a strong and cunning enemy. The mortar now sent to fetch the bee and the chestnut (also the crab's old friends) to consult them about the matter. In a short time the bee and the chestnut arrived. When they were told all the details of the old crab's death and of the monkey's wickedness and greed, they both gladly consented to help the young crab in his revenge.

After talking for a long time as to the ways and means of carrying out their plans they separated, and Mr. Mortar went home with the young crab to help him bury his poor father.",37,avenge,is the antonym of,forgive,What is the opposite of forgive?,Avenge.
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,14,"While all this was taking place the monkey was congratulating himself (as the wicked often do before their punishment comes upon them) on all he had done so neatly. He thought it quite a fine thing that he had robbed his friend of all his ripe persimmons and then that he had killed him. Still, smile as hard as he might, he could not banish altogether the fear of the consequences should his evil deeds be discovered. IF he were found out (and he told himself that this could not be for he had escaped unseen) the crab's family would be sure to bear him hatred and seek to take revenge on him. So he would not go out, and kept himself at home for several days. He found this kind of life, however, extremely dull, accustomed as he was to the free life of the woods, and at last he said:

""No one knows that it was I who killed the crab! I am sure that the old thing breathed his last before I left him. Dead crabs have no mouths! Who is there to tell that I am the murderer?

quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,16,"Little did he know in his so-called ""monkey's wisdom"" that this seeming unconcern was part of the young crab's plan. He purposely pretended not to know who killed his father, and also to believe that he had met his death through his own fault. By this means he could the better keep secret the revenge on the monkey, which he was meditating.

So the monkey returned home from his walk quite content. He told himself he had nothing now to fear.",69,meditate,has subevent,relax,How can one relax themself?,They can meditate.

""I have been sent by my master to inform you that his father died the other day in falling from a persimmon tree while trying to climb the tree after fruit. This, being the seventh day, is the first anniversary after his death, and my master has prepared a little festival in his father's honor, and bids you come to participate in it as you were one of his best friends.

""I am, indeed, very sorry to hear of your chief's death. We were great friends as you know. I remember that we once exchanged a rice-dumpling for a persimmon-seed.

When he had gone, the wicked monkey laughed aloud at what he thought was the young crab's innocence, and without the least feeling began to look forward to the feast to be held that day in honor of the dead crab, to which he had been invited.

It was the chestnut, one of the crab's friends, who had hidden himself in the fireplace. The monkey, taken by surprise, jumped backward, and then started to run out of the room.

The bee, who was hiding outside the screens, now flew out and stung him on the cheek.

Was it possible for the monkey to bear the weight of the mortar falling on him from the top of the gate? He lay crushed and in great pain, quite unable to get up. As he lay there helpless the young crab came up, and, holding his great claw scissors over the monkey, he said:

""Do you now remember that you murdered my father?""

""Then you-are-my-enemy?"" gasped the monkey brokenly.

""Of course,"" said the young crab.

""It-was-your-father's-fault-not-mine!"" gasped the unrepentant monkey.

""Can you still lie? I will soon put an end to your breath!"" and with that he cut off the monkey's head with his pitcher claws. Thus the wicked monkey met his well-merited punishment, and the young crab avenged his father's death.

how they were. But he was much surprised to see that Sheep-Peter was
keeping them company. Then the youth said: ""I was in the war, and slew
all of the enemy!"" ""Ah!"" said the king, ""you did not do that, it was
an angel from heaven; for you were sitting in the swamp."" Then
Sheep-Peter drew out the king's handkerchief, and then the king
recognized him. Then the herdsman said: ""I also delivered the
princesses!"" But the king would not believe that, and laughed at him.
And then the youngest princess came along and told how it all had
happened.",107,handkerchief,is used for,wipe_nose,What can people do with handkerchief when they're having a cold?,People can use handkerchief to wipe their noses.

king had to believe that this, too, was true. Then, Peter continued:

and said: ""Nonsense, why you never brought home anything of an evening
but a wretched crow!"" Then Peter produced the golden apples: ""I was
given this one for the first day, and the other for the second."" ""And
what did you get for the third?"" asked the king. Then the shepherd
showed him what he had written on the necks of the other suitors. And
when the king saw that, he had to believe him. And so he really got
the youngest princess, and with her half of the kingdom, and after
the king's death, all of it. But the two sham heroes got nothing at

""I obtained the first prize,"" said the hare. ""Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself.""
""No,"" said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; ""there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance. I have heard many respectable people say so, and I can quite understand it. The snail certainly took half a year to get over the threshold of the door; but he injured himself, and broke his collar-bone by the haste he made.

Be so kind as to give me your attention, and I will explain to you how I reckon from the beginning. The eighth letter from A is H, and there we have H for hare; therefore I awarded to the hare the first prize.

No; there is something else on which more stress should be laid, and which ought not be left unnoticed. I mean that which mankind call the beautiful.

Not long ago, I crushed the hind legs of a young hare. He had been running a long time before the engine; he had no idea that I was travelling there.

The sunbeam flies in a few minutes along the immeasurable path from the sun to us. It arrives in such strength, that all nature awakes to loveliness and beauty; we roses blush and exhale fragrance in its presence. Our worshipful judges don't appear to have noticed this at all.

The snail can now sit on the fence, and lick up moss and sunshine. He has also been appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing.

red-shoes,1,"Once upon a time there was little girl, pretty and dainty. But in summer time she was obliged to go barefooted because she was poor, and in winter she had to wear large wooden shoes, so that her little instep grew quite red.
In the middle of the village lived an old shoemaker's wife; she sat down and made, as well as she could, a pair of little shoes out of some old pieces of red cloth. They were clumsy, but she meant well, for they were intended for the little girl, whose name was Karen.
Karen received the shoes and wore them for the first time on the day of her mother's funeral. They were certainly not suitable for mourning; but she had no others, and so she put her bare feet into them and walked behind the humble coffin.
Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an old lady; she looked at the little girl, and taking pity on her, said to the clergyman, ""Look here, if you will give me the little girl, I will take care of her.""",34,wear,has subevent,dress,What does it mean by wearing clothes?,It means dressing oneself in clothes.

One day the Queen was travelling through that part of the country, and had her little daughter, who was a princess, with her. All the people, amongst them Karen too, streamed towards the castle, where the little princess, in fine white clothes, stood before the window and allowed herself to be stared at. She wore neither a train nor a golden crown, but beautiful red morocco shoes; they were indeed much finer than those which the shoemaker's wife had sewn for little Karen.

It all looked very lovely, but the old lady could not see very well, and therefore did not get much pleasure out of it. Amongst the shoes stood a pair of red ones, like those which the princess had worn. How beautiful they were! and the shoemaker said that they had been made for a count's daughter, but that they had not fitted her.
""I suppose they are of shiny leather?"" asked the old lady. ""They shine so.""
""Yes, they do shine,"" said Karen. They fitted her, and were bought. But the old lady knew nothing of their being red, for she would never have allowed Karen to be confirmed in red shoes, as she was now to be.",174,lady,is the antonym of,gentleman,What is the opposite of lady?,Gentleman.

The organ pealed forth solemnly, and the sweet children's voices mingled with that of their old leader; but Karen thought only of her red shoes.

The sun was shining gloriously, so Karen and the old lady went along the footpath through the corn, where it was rather dusty.
At the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning on a crutch; he had a wonderfully long beard, more red than white, and he bowed down to the ground and asked the old lady whether he might wipe her shoes. Then Karen put out her little foot too. ""Dear me, what pretty dancing-shoes!"" said the soldier. ""Sit fast, when you dance,"" said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand.
The old lady gave the soldier some money and then went with Karen into the church.
And all the people inside looked at Karen's red shoes, and all the figures gazed at them; when Karen knelt before the altar and put the golden goblet to her mouth, she thought only of the red shoes.

It seemed as if the shoes had got power over them. She danced round the church corner, for she could not stop; the coachman had to run after her and seize her.

She looked at the red shoes, saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that; she put the red shoes on, thinking there was no harm in that either; and then she went to the ball; and commenced to dance.
But when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced down the room, down the stairs through the street, and out through the gates of the town. She danced, and was obliged to dance, far out into the dark wood. Suddenly something shone up among the trees, and she believed it was the moon, for it was a face.

She danced out into the open churchyard; but the dead there did not dance. They had something better to do than that. She wanted to sit down on the pauper's grave where the bitter fern grows; but for her there was neither peace nor rest.

And the executioner said: ""I don't suppose you know who I am. I strike off the heads of the wicked, and I notice that my axe is tingling to do so.""
""Don't cut off my head!"" said Karen, ""for then I could not repent of my sin. But cut off my feet with the red shoes.""
And then she confessed all her sin, and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes; but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep forest.

The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.""

Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for myself, I don't care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any hearts.

""Ah! what a trivial view of life!"" said the Rocket; ""but it is only what I expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor people, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall never get over it.""",174,drown,has subevent,die,What is drown?,Drown is when one dies from not being able to breathe underwater.

I hate people who cry over spilt milk.  But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.""

""You certainly are!"" cried the Bengal Light.  ""In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.""

""Very important for you, I have no doubt,"" answered the Rocket, ""but I shall weep if I choose""; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in.

Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.

The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.

Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.

""Let the fireworks begin,"" said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.",89,lily,is a,flower,What is lily?,"Lily is a kind flower, usually in white color."

Whizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.  Boom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  ""Good-bye,"" cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.  Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.  He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.

But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them caught sight of him.  ""Hallo!"" he cried, ""what a bad rocket!"" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.

""Bad Rocket?  Bad Rocket?"" he said, as he whirled through the air; ""impossible!  Grand Rocket, that is what the man said.  Bad and Grand sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same""; and he fell into the mud.

""Ahem! ahem!"" said the Rocket, and he began to cough.

""What a delightful voice you have!"" cried the Frog.  ""Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer's house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.  It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.""",126,croak,is a,utterance,What is a croak?,"A croak is a faint and low-voiced utterance, such as a frog's croak."

I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.""

""Conversation, indeed!"" said the Rocket.  ""You have talked the whole time yourself.  That is not conversation.""

""Somebody must listen,"" answered the Frog, ""and I like to do all the talking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.""

""You are a very irritating person,"" said the Rocket, ""and very ill-bred.  I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.  Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately.

It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.""

""Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,"" said the Dragon-fly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.

""How very silly of him not to stay here!"" said the Rocket.  ""I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However, I don't care a bit.

""It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,"" answered the Rocket, ""otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your ignorance.

""I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,"" remarked the Duck; ""there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much effect.

""Come back! come back!"" screamed the Rocket, ""I have a great deal to say to you""; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  ""I am glad that she has gone,"" he said to himself, ""she has a decidedly middle-class mind""; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some sticks.

""Let us put it into the fire!"" said the other boy, ""it will help to boil the kettle.""

""Now I am going off!"" he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.  ""I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high that-""

But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.

Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.

He was very fond of reading, and so he always carried one book or
another along with him, with which he could lie down, and which he
read on holidays, or when the weather forced him to stay in the little
fishing-hut. One Sunday morning, as he was lying there reading, it
seemed as though he could hear church bells; sometimes they sounded
faintly, as though from a great distance; at other times the sound
was clear, as though carried by the wind. He listened long and with
surprise; and did not trust his ears--for he knew that it was impossible
to hear the bells of the parish church so far out among the hills--yet
suddenly they sounded quite clearly on his ear. So he laid aside his
book, stood up and went out. The sun was shining, the weather was fine, and one group of churchgoers after another passed him in their Sunday clothes, their hymn-books in their hands.

And when they came to the spot where the schoolmaster was standing, they stopped and invited him to come to church and hear mass. The schoolmaster thought for a moment; but since it occurred to him that it might be amusing to see how these people worshiped God, he said he would go along, if he did not thereby suffer harm. No, no harm should come to him, said they, but rather a blessing. In the church all went forward in a quiet and orderly manner, there were neither dogs nor crying children to disturb the service, and the singing was good--but he could not make out the words. When the priest had been led to the pulpit he delivered what seemed to the listening schoolmaster a really fine and edifying sermon--but one, it appeared to him, of quite a peculiar trend of thought, which he was not always able to follow. Nor did the ""Our Father in heaven ..."" sound just right, and the ""Deliver us from evil ..."" he did not hear at all.

And as before, they assured him he would not lose; but rather gain thereby. So he went with them to the parsonage, just such an attractive and well-built parsonage like most in the neighborhood. It had a garden with flowers and apple-trees, with a neat lattice fence around it. They invited him to dinner, and the dinner was well cooked and carefully prepared. As before, he said that he would gladly accept their invitation, if he came to no harm thereby, and was given the same reply. So he ate with them, and said later that he had noticed no difference between this food and the Christian dinner he had received when, once or twice, he had been asked to dinner by the priest of the village church.

and able man, and finally, that she and her daughter would like to
have him for priest, and whether he would not stay and succeed the old

insisted that he had more learning than was needed in their case, for
they never had any visits from the bishop, nor did the dean ever hold a
chapter, for of all such things they knew nothing. When the schoolmaster
heard that, he said that even though he had the necessary scholarship,
he doubted very much that he had the right vocation, and since this was
a most important matter for him and for them, it would be unwise to act
too hurriedly, so he would ask for a year to think it over. When he had

sheem-the-forsaken-boy,1,"On a certain afternoon the sun was falling in the West, and in the midst
of the ruddy silence a solitary lodge stood on the banks of a remote
lake. One sound only broke, in the least degree, the forest
stillness. The low breathing of the dying inmate, who was the head of a
poor family. His wife and children surrounded the buffalo robe on which
he lay. Of the children, two were almost grown up--a daughter and a son. 
The other was a boy, and a mere child in years.

All the skill of the household in their simple medicines was exhausted. They stood looking on or moved about the lodge with whispered steps,
awaiting the departure of the spirit. As one of the last acts of
kindness, the skin door of the lodge had been thrown back to admit the
fresh air of the evening. The poor man felt a momentary return of
strength, and raising himself a little, he addressed his family.

you will not remain long behind me. But you, my children! My poor and
forsaken children, who have just begun the career of life, who will
shelter you from calamity? Listen to my words. Unkindness, ingratitude,
and every wickedness, are in the scene before you. It was for this that
years ago I withdrew from my kindred and my tribe to spend my days in
this lonely spot. I have contented myself with the company of your
mother and yourselves, during seasons of very frequent scarcity and
want. Your kindred, feasting in plenty, have caused the forests to
echo with the shouts of successful war. I gave up these things for the
enjoyment of peace. I wished to hide you away from the bad examples
which would have spoiled your innocence. I have seen you, thus far, grow
up in purity of heart. If we have sometimes suffered bodily want, we
have escaped pain of mind. We have not been compelled to look on or to
take a part with the red hand in scenes of rioting and bloodshed. My
path now stops. I have arrived at the brink of the world. I will shut my
eyes in peace if you, my children, will promise me to cherish each
other. Let not your mother suffer during the few days that are left to
her. I charge you, on no account, to forsake your younger brother.

from his face. The family stood still, as if they expected to hear
something further. But when they came to his side and called him by
name, his spirit did not answer. It was in another world.

The mother and daughter lamented aloud, but the elder son clothed
himself in silence, as though it had been a mantle. He took his course
as though nothing had occurred. He exerted himself to supply, with his
bow and net, the wants of the little household, but he never made
mention of his father.

Five moons had filled and waned, and the sixth was near its full, when

cheered the spirits of the lonely little people in the lodge.

The girl, being the eldest, directed her brothers. She seemed to
feel a tender and sisterly affection for the youngest, who was slight in
frame and of a delicate temper. The other boy soon began to break forth
with restless speeches, which showed that his spirit was not at ease.
One day he addressed his sister as follows:

""My sister, are we always to live as if there were no other human beings
in the world? Must I deprive myself of the pleasure of mingling with my
own kind? I have determined this question for myself. I shall seek the
villages of men, and you can not prevent me.""",132,question,causes,find_information,Why do we ask questions about something?,We ask questions to find information about something.

""I do not say no, my brother, to what you desire. We are not forbidden
the society of our fellow-mortals, but we are told to cherish each
other, and to do nothing that shall not be agreeable to all our little
household. Neither pleasure nor pain ought, therefore, to separate us,
especially from our younger brother, who, being but a child, and weakly
withal, is entitled to a double share of our affection. If we follow our
separate fancies, it will surely make us neglect him, whom we are bound
by vows, both to our father and mother, to support.""

The young man received this address in silence, and still took his
course as though nothing out of the ordinary way had occurred. After
awhile he seemed to recover his spirits. As they lived in a large
country, where there were open fields, the two brothers, at his
invitation, often amused themselves in playing ball. One afternoon he
chose the ground near to a beautiful lake, and they played and laughed
with great spirit. The ball was seldom allowed to touch the ground.",130,address,is used for,describe_where_person_lives,When do we usually use address?,We use address to describe where a person lives.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,6,"Now in this lake there happened to harbor a wicked old Manito, Mishosha
by name, who looked at the brothers as they played. He was vastly
pleased with their nimbleness and beauty. He thought to himself, what
shall I do to get these lads to accompany me? One of them shall hit the
ball sideways, and it shall fall into my canoe.

It so happened, and it somehow seemed as if Owasso, the elder brother,
had purposely given it that direction. When Owasso saw the old man, he
professed to be greatly surprised. As was the other, Sheem by name, in
truth, for he had not noticed the old Manito before.

""Bring the ball to us,"" they both cried out. ""Come to the shore.""

""No,"" answered the old magician. He, however, came near enough for
either of them to wade out to him. ""Come, come,"" he said. ""Come and get
your ball.""

oblige them.",68,canoe,has property,long_and_skinny,What is a canoe like?,A canoe is a long and skinny boat.

receive it.

""Ha!"" answered the Manito, ""reach over and get it yourself.""

Owasso was about to grasp the ball, when the old magician suddenly
seized him and pushed him into the boat.

""My grandfather,"" said Owasso, ""pray take my little brother also. Alone
I can not go with you. He will starve if I leave him.""

Mishosha only laughed at him. Then uttering the charmed words, ""Chemaun
Poll!"" and giving his canoe a slap, it glided through the water, without
further help, with the swiftness of an arrow.

In a short time they reached the magician's lodge, which stood upon the
further shore, a little distance back from the lake. The two daughters
of Mishosha were seated within. ""My daughter,"" he said to his eldest, as
they entered the lodge, ""I have brought you a husband.""",67,ball,is capable of,bounce,What can a ball do when it hits the floor?,A ball can bounce when it hits the floor.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,8,"The young woman smiled. Owasso was a comely youth to look upon. The
magician told him to take his seat near her. By this act the
marriage ceremony was completed, and Owasso and the magician's daughter
were man and wife. In the course of time they had born to them a
son.

But no sooner was Owasso in the family than the old Manito wished him
out of the way. He went about in his own wicked fashion to compass
it.

One day he asked his son-in-law to go out a-fishing with him. They
started without delay. The magician had only to speak, and off went
the canoe. They reached a solitary bay in an island, a very dark,
lonely, and out-of-the-way place. The Manito advised Owasso to spear a
large sturgeon which came alongside, and with its great glassy eye
turned up, seemed to recognize the magician. Owasso rose in the boat to
dart his spear, and by speaking that moment to his canoe, Mishosha shot
forward and hurled his son-in-law headlong into the water. Leaving him to struggle for himself, he was soon out of sight.",15,magician,is a,performer,What is a magician?,A magician is a performer of magic.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,9,"Owasso, being himself gifted with limited magical powers, spoke to the
fish, and bade him swim toward the lodge, while he carried him along,
which he did at great speed. Once he directed the sturgeon to rise near
the surface of the water, so that he might, if possible, get a view of
the magician. The fish obeyed, and Owasso saw the wicked old Manito busy
in another direction, fishing, as unconcerned as though he had not just
lost a member of his family.

On went the fish, and on went Owasso, till they reached the shore, near
the magician's lodge, in advance of him. He then spoke kindly to the
sturgeon, and told him he should not be angry with him for having
speared him, as he was created to be meat for man. The sturgeon made no
reply, or if he did, it has not been reported. Owasso, drawing him
on shore, went up and told his wife to dress and cook it immediately. By
the time it was prepared the magician had come in sight.

""Your grandfather has arrived,"" said the woman to her son. ""Go and see
what he brings, and eat this as you go""--handing a piece of the fish.

The boy went, and the magician no sooner saw him with the fish in his
hand, than he asked him, ""What are you eating? and who brought it?""",180,shore,is at location of,beach,What do we usually see a shore?,We usually see a shore at a beach.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,10,"He replied, ""My father brought it.""

The magician began to feel uneasy, for he found that he had been
outwitted. He, however, put on a grave face, and entering the lodge,
acted as if nothing unusual had happened.

Some days after this, Mishosha again requested his son-in-law to
accompany him. Owasso, without hesitation, said ""Yes!""

They went out, and, in a rapid passage, they arrived at a solitary
island, which was no more than a heap of high and craggy rocks.

The magician said to Owasso, ""Go on shore, my son, and pick up all the
gulls' eggs you can find.""

The rocks were strewn with eggs, and the air resounded with the cry of
the birds as they saw them gathered up by Owasso.

The old magician took the opportunity to speak to the gulls. ""I have
long wished,"" he said, ""to offer you something. I now give you this
young man for food.""

He then uttered the charm to his canoe, and it shot out of sight,
leaving Owasso to make his peace the best way he could.",45,unusual,is the antonym of,usual,What is the antonym of unusual?,Usual.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,11,"The gulls flew in immense numbers around him, and were ready to devour
him. Owasso did not lose his presence of mind, but he addressed them and
said:

""Gulls, you know you were not formed to eat human flesh, nor was man
made to be the prey of birds. Obey my words. Fly close together, a
sufficient number of you, and carry me on your backs to the magician's
lodge.""

They listened attentively to what he said, and seeing nothing
unreasonable in his request, they obeyed him. Owasso soon found
himself sailing through the air swiftly homeward.

Meanwhile, it appears that the old magician had fallen asleep and
allowed his canoe to come to a stand-still. Owasso, in his flight
over the lake, saw him lying on his back in the boat, taking a nap,
which was quite natural, as the day was very soft and balmy.",107,sail,has subevent,travel,What is a sail?,A sail is a travel on the sea.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,12,"As Owasso, with his convoy of birds, passed over, he let fall, directly
in the face of the old magician, a capful of gulls' eggs. They broke
and so besmeared his eyes that he could barely see. He jumped up and
exclaimed:

""It is always so with these thoughtless birds. They never consider where
they drop their eggs.""

Owasso had flown on and reached the lodge in safety, and, excusing
himself for the liberty, he killed two or three of the gulls for the
sake of their feathers to ornament his son's head.

When the magician arrived, soon after, his grandson came out to meet
him, tossing his head about as the feathers danced and struggled with
the wind.

""Where did you get these?"" asked the Manito, ""and who brought them?""

""My father brought them,"" the boy replied.

The old magician was quite distressed in his mind that he had not
destroyed his son-in-law. He entered his lodge in silence, and set his
wits busily at work again to contrive some plan for easing his feelings
in that respect.",63,consider,has subevent,think_about,What does mean by considering?,Considering something means thinking about something.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,13,"He could not help saying to himself:

""What manner of boy is this who is ever escaping from my power? But his
guardian spirit shall not save him. I will entrap him to-morrow. Ha, ha,
ha!""

He was painfully aware that he had tried two of his charms without
effect, and that he had but two more left. He now professed to be more
friendly with his son-in-law than ever, and the very next day he said to
Owasso:

""Come, my son, you must go with me to procure some young eagles. We
will tame them, and have them for pets about the lodge. I have
discovered an island where they are in great abundance.""

They started on the trip. When, after traversing an immense waste of
water, they had reached the island, Mishosha led him inland until they
came to the foot of a tall pine-tree, upon which the nests were to be
found.

""Now, my son,"" said Mishosha, ""climb up this tree and bring down the
birds. I think you will get some fine ones up there.""

Owasso obeyed. When he had with great difficulty got near the nest,
Mishosha cried out, addressing himself to the tree, and without much
regard to the wishes of Owasso:

""Now stretch yourself up and be very tall.""",227,nest,is a,shelter_for_birds,What is a nest?,A nest is a shelter or house for birds.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,14,"The tree, at this bidding, rose up so far that Owasso would have
imperiled his neck by any attempt to get to the ground.

""Listen, ye eagles!"" continued Mishosha. ""You have long expected a gift
from me. I now present you this boy, who has had the presumption to
climb up where you are to molest your young. Stretch forth your claws
and seize him.""

So saying, the old magician, according to his custom in such cases,
turned his back upon Owasso. Going off in his canoe at a word, he
left his son-in-law to shift for himself.

But the birds did not seem to be so badly-minded as the old magician had
supposed. a very old bald eagle, quite corpulent and large of limb,
alighting on a branch just opposite, opened conversation with him by
asking what had brought him there.

Owasso replied that he had not mounted the tree of himself, or out of
any disposition to harm his people. his father-in-law, the old
magician who had just left them, had sent him up. He was constantly
sending him on mischievous errands. In a word, the young man was
enlarging at great length upon the character of the wicked Manito. He was interrupted by being darted upon by a hungry-eyed bird, with long
claws.

Owasso, not in the least disconcerted, boldly seized this fierce eagle
by the neck and dashed it against the rocks, crying out:

""Thus will I deal with all who come near me.""",73,claw,is part of,paw,What is a bear's claw?,A bear's claw is part of a bear's paw.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,15,"The old eagle, who appeared to be the head of the tribe, was so pleased
with this show of spirit that he immediately appointed two tall birds,
uncommonly strong in the wings, to transport Owasso to his lodge. They
were to take turns in conducting him through the air.

Owasso expressed many obligations to the old eagle for his kindness, and
they forthwith set out. It was a high point from which they started, for
the pine-tree had shot far, far up toward the clouds, and they could
even descry the enchanted island where the old magician lived, though it
was miles and miles away. For this point they steered their flight. In a short time they landed Owasso at the door of the lodge.

With many compliments for their dispatch, Owasso dismissed the birds,
and stood ready to greet his wicked father-in-law who now arrived. When he espied his son-in-law still unharmed, Mishosha grew very black
in the face. He had but a single charm left.",34,wing,is used for,flying,What do birds use their wings for?,Birds use their wings for flying.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,16,"He thought he would ponder deeply how he could employ that to the best
advantage. It happened that while he was doing so, one evening, as
Owasso and his wife were sitting on the banks of the lake, and the soft
breeze swept over it, they heard a song, as if sung by some one at a
great distance. The sound continued for some time, and then died away in
perfect stillness. ""Oh, it is the voice of Sheem,"" cried Owasso. ""It is
the voice of my brother! If I could but only see him!"" And he hung down
his head in deep anguish.

His wife witnessed his distress, and to comfort him she proposed that
they should attempt to make their escape, and carry him succor on the
morrow.

When the morning came, and the sun shone warmly into the lodge, the wife
of Owasso offered to comb her father's hair, with the hope that it
would soothe him to sleep. It had that effect. They no sooner saw
him in deep slumber than they seized the magic canoe, Owasso uttered the
charmed words, ""Chemaun Poll!"" and they glided away upon the water
without need of oar or sail.",99,voice,has property,loud,Can your voice be loud?,"Yes, my voice can be loud."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,17,"They had nearly reached the land on the opposite side of the lake, and
could distinctly hear the voice of the younger brother singing his
lament as before, when the old magician wakened. Missing his daughter
and her husband, he suspected deception of some kind. He looked for his
magic boat and found it gone. He spoke the magic words, which were more
powerful from him than from any other person in the world, and the canoe
immediately returned; to the sore disappointment of Owasso and his wife.

When they came back to the shore, Mishosha stood upon the beach and drew
up his canoe. He did not utter a word. The son-in-law and daughter
entered the lodge in silence.

The time, walking along in its broad open path, brought the autumn
months to a close, and the winter had set in. Soon after the first fall
of snow, Owasso said:

""Father, I wish to try my skill in hunting. It is said there is plenty
of game not far off, and it can now be easily tracked. Let us go.""",190,game,is a,activity,What is a game that you play with your friends?,A game is an interesting activity.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,18,"The magician consented. They set out, and arriving at a good ground for
their sport, they spent the day in hunting. Night coming on, they built
themselves a lodge of pine-branches to sleep in. Although it was
bitterly cold, the young man took off his leggings and moccasins, and
hung them up to dry. The old magician did the same, carefully hanging
his own in a separate place, and they lay down to sleep.

Owasso, from a glance he had given, suspected that the magician had a
mind to play him a trick. To be ahead of  him, he watched an
opportunity to get up and change the moccasins and leggings, putting his
own in the place of Mishosha's, and depending on the darkness of the
lodge to help him through.

Near daylight, the old magician bestirred himself, as if to rekindle the
fire. He slyly reached down a pair of moccasins and leggings with a
stick, and thinking they were no other than those of Owasso's, he
dropped them into the flames. He cast himself down, and affected
to be lost in a heavy sleep. The leather leggings and moccasins soon
drew up and were burned.",44,cold,causes,light_fire,What do hunters do when they feel cold?,Hunters light a fire when they feel cold.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,19,"Instantly jumping up and rubbing his eyes, Mishosha cried out:

""Son-in-law, your moccasins are burning. I know it by the smell.""

Owasso rose up, deliberately and unconcerned.

""No, my friend,"" said he, ""here are mine,"" at the same time taking them
down and drawing them on. ""It is your moccasins that are burning.""

Mishosha dropped his head upon his breast. All his tricks were played
out--there was not so much as half a one left to help him out of the
sorry plight he was in.

""I believe, my grandfather,"" added Owasso, ""that this is the moon in
which fire attracts. I fear you must have set your foot and leg
garments too near the fire, and they have been drawn in. Now let us go
forth to the hunt.""

The old magician was compelled to follow him, and they pushed out into a
great storm of snow, and hail, and wind, which had come on over night.
Neither the wind, the hail, nor the snow, had the slightest respect
for the bare limbs of the old magician, for there was not the least
virtue of magic in those parts of old Mishosha's body. After a while
they quite stiffened under him, his body became hard, and the hair
bristled in the cold wind, so that he looked to Owasso--who turned away
from him, leaving the wicked old magician alone to ponder upon his past
life. To Owasso he looked like a tough old sycamore-tree more than a
highly-gifted old magician.",4,rub,has subevent,touch,Do you need to touch your hands if you want to rub your hands?,"Yes, I need to touch my hand to rub my hands."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,20,"Owasso himself reached home in safety, proof against all kinds of
weather, and the magic canoe became the exclusive property of the young
man and his wife.

During all this part of Owasso's stay at the lodge of Mishosha, his
sister, whom he had left on the main land with Sheem, their younger
brother, had labored with good-will to supply the lodge. She knew enough
of the arts of the forest to provide their daily food. She watched
her little brother, and tended his wants, with all of a good sister's
care. By times she began to be weary of solitude and of her charge. No
one came to be a witness of her constancy, or to let fall a single word
in her mother-tongue. She could not converse with the birds and beasts
about her, and she felt, to the bottom of her heart, that she was alone.
In these thoughts she forgot her younger brother. She almost wished him
dead; for it was he alone that kept her from seeking the companionship
of others.

One day, after collecting all the provisions she had been able to
reserve from their daily use, and bringing a supply of wood to the door,
she said to her little brother:

""My brother, you must not stray from the lodge. I am going to seek our
elder brother. I shall be back soon.""",223,wood,is a,material,What is wood?,Wood is a kind of material from trees used for building things.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,21,"She then set the lodge in perfect order, and, taking her bundle, she set
off in search of habitations. These she soon found, and in the enjoyment
of the pleasures and pastimes of her new acquaintance, she began to
think less and less of her little brother, Sheem. She accepted proposals
of marriage, and from that time she utterly forgot the abandoned boy.

As for poor little Sheem, he was soon brought to the pinching turn of
his fate. As soon as he had eaten all of the food left in the lodge, he
was obliged to pick berries, and live off of such roots as he could dig
with his slender hands. As he wandered about in search of wherewithal to
stay his hunger, he often looked up to heaven, and saw the gray clouds
going up and down. And then he looked about upon the wide earth, but he
never saw sister nor brother returning from their long delay.

At last, even the roots and berries gave out. They were blighted by the
frost or hidden out of reach by the snow, for the mid-winter had come
on, and poor little Sheem was obliged to leave the lodge and wander away
in search of food.",139,hunger,causes,eat,What will you do when you feel hungry?,I eat.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,22,"Sometimes he was enforced to pass the night in the clefts of old trees
or caverns, and to break his fast with the refuse meals of the savage
wolves.

These at last became his only resource, and he grew to be so little
fearful of these animals that he would sit by them while they devoured
their meat, and patiently await his share.

After a while, the wolves took to little Sheem very kindly, and seeming
to understand his outcast condition, they would always leave something
for him to eat. By and by they began to talk with him, and to inquire
into his history. When he told them that he had been forsaken by his
brother and his sister, the wolves turned about to each other, lifted up
their eyes to heaven, and wondered among themselves, with raised paws,
that such a thing should have been.

In this way, Sheem lived on till the spring, and as soon as the lake was
free from ice, he followed his new friends to the shore.",73,wolf,is capable of,give_howl,What can wolves do to scare animals away?,Wolves can give howl.
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,23,"It happened on the same day, that his elder brother, Owasso, was fishing
in his magic canoe, a considerable distance out upon the lake. He
thought he heard the cries of a child upon the shore. He wondered how
any human creature could exist on so bleak and barren a coast.

He listened again with all attention, and he heard the cry distinctly
repeated. This time it was the well-known cry of his younger brother
that reached his ear. He knew too well the secret of his song, as he
heard him chaunting mournfully:

""My brother! My brother! Since you left me going in the canoe, a-hee-ee,
I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee. I am half changed into a wolf,
E-wee.""

Owasso made for the shore, and as he approached the lament was repeated.

sorrowful for Owasso to listen to. It touched him the more that it
died away at the close, into a long-drawn howl, like that of the wolf.",196,howl,is a,animal_noise,What is a howl?,A howl is an animal noise.

animal fleeing away; and besides these the prints of human hands. But
what were the pity and astonishment that smote Owasso to the heart when
he espied his poor little brother--poor little forsaken Sheem--half boy
and half wolf, flying along the shore.

Owasso immediately leaped upon the ground and strove to catch him in his
arms, saying soothingly, ""My brother! my brother! Come to me.""

But the poor wolf-boy avoided his grasp, crying, as he fled, ""Neesia,
neesia. Since you left me going in the canoe, a-he-ee, I am half changed
into a wolf, E-wee. I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee!"" and howling
between these words of lament.

The elder brother, sore at heart, and feeling all of his brotherly
affection strongly returning, with renewed anguish, cried out, ""My
brother! my brother! my brother!""

But the nearer he approached to poor Sheem, the faster he fled, and the
more rapidly the change went on. The boy-wolf by turns singing and
howling, and calling out the name, first of his brother and then of his
sister, till the change was complete. He leaped upon a bank, and looking
back, and casting upon Owasso a glance of deep reproach and grief, he
exclaimed, ""I am a wolf!"" and disappeared in the woods.",20,flee,has subevent,run,What does it mean by fleeing somewhere?,Fleeing somewhere means running away from somewhere.

at the window, and a voice which said: ""Come, Silverwhite, I have to
talk to you!"" The king, who did not want to wake his young wife, rose
hastily, girded on his sword, called his dogs and went out. When he
reached the open air, there stood a huge and savage-looking troll. The
troll said: ""Silverwhite, you have slain my three brothers, and I have
come to bid you go down to the sea-shore with me, that we may fight
with one another."" This proposal suited the youth, and he followed the
troll without protest. When they reached the sea-shore, there lay
three great dogs belonging to the troll. Silverwhite at once set his
dogs at the troll-dogs. After a hard struggle the latter had to
give in. The young king drew his sword, bravely attacked the troll and
dealt him many a mighty blow. It was a tremendous battle.",162,struggle,is a,effort,What is struggle?,Struggle is when you try to do something difficult with great effort.

quickly ran to a high tree, and clambered into it. Silverwhite and the
dogs ran after him, the dogs barking as loudly as they could. Then the
troll begged for his life and said: ""Dear Silverwhite, I will take
wergild for my brothers, only bid your dogs be still, so that we may
talk."" The king bade his dogs be still, but in vain, they only barked
the more loudly. Then the troll tore three hairs from his head, handed
them to Silverwhite and said: ""Lay a hair on each of the dogs, and
then they will be as quiet as can be."" The king did so and at once the
dogs fell silent, and lay motionless as though they had grown fast to
the ground. Now Silverwhite realized that he had been deceived; but it
was too late. The troll was already descending from the tree, and he
drew his sword and again began to fight. But they had exchanged no
more than a few blows, before Silverwhite received a mortal wound, and
lay on the earth in a pool of blood.",49,beg,has subevent,request,What is beg?,Beg is when you request for something badly.

that Silverwhite was dead. He called his dogs, hung his sword at his
side, and went on until he came to a great city. And the city was in
festal array, the streets were crowded with people, and the houses
were hung with scarlet cloths and splendid rugs. Lillwacker asked why
everybody was so happy, and they said: ""You must hail from distant
parts, since you do not know that a famous hero has come here by the
name of Silverwhite. He has rescued our three princesses, and is now
the king's son-in-law."" Lillwacker then inquired how it had all come

had been the king. For he resembled his foster-brother so closely that
none could tell one from the other. When the youth came to the queen's
room, she also took him for Silverwhite. She went up to him and said:

went. When he reached the open air, there stood the same troll who had
slain Silverwhite. He said: ""Come with me, Lillwacker, and then you
shall see your foster-brother!"" To this Lillwacker at once agreed, and
the troll led the way. When they came to the sea-shore, there lay the
three great dogs whom the troll had brought with him. Somewhat further
away, where they had fought, lay Silverwhite in a pool of blood, and
beside him his dogs were stretched out on the ground as though they
had taken root in it. Then Lillwacker saw how everything had happened,
and thought that he would gladly venture his life, if he might in some
way call his brother back from the dead. He at once set his dogs at
the troll-dogs, and they had a hard struggle, in which Lillwacker's
dogs won the victory. Then the youth drew his sword, and attacked the
troll with mighty blows. But when the troll saw that he was getting

hairs from his head and added: ""Lay one of these hairs on each of your

""What is there you can give me that will compensate for my brother's
life?"" The troll replied: ""Here are two flasks. In one is a liquid
which, if you anoint a dead man with it, it will restore him to life.
As to the liquid in the other flask, if you moisten anything with
it, and some one touches the place you have moistened, he will be

something else you must promise to do: that you will release my
brother's dogs."" The troll agreed, climbed down from the tree,
breathed on the dogs and thus freed them. Then Lillwacker took the two
flasks and went away from the sea-shore with the troll. After they had
gone a while they came to a great flat stone, lying near the highway.
Lillwacker hastened on in advance and moistened it with liquid from
the second flask. Then, as he was going by, Lillwacker suddenly set
all six of his dogs at the troll, who stepped back and touched the
stone. There he stuck, and could move neither forward nor backward.

saw the sun he burst--and was as dead as a doornail!",29,release,is a,free,What is release?,Release is when you free someone or something.

liquid in the other flask, so that he came to life again, and they
were both very happy, as may well be imagined. The two foster-brothers
then returned to the castle, recounting the story of their experiences
and adventures on the way. Lillwacker told how he had been taken for
his brother. He even mentioned that he had lain down on a couch in a
corner of the queen's room, and that she had never suspected that he
was not her rightful husband. But when Silverwhite heard that, he
thought that Lillwacker had offended against the queen's dignity, and
he grew angry and fell into such a rage that he drew his sword, and
thrust it into his brother's breast. Lillwacker fell to earth dead,

Then the queen said: ""I am very curious to know what has befallen you
during the last few days, but what I would like to know most of all,
is why you lay down on a couch in a corner of my room the other
night?"" Now it was clear to Silverwhite that the brother he had slain
was innocent of all offense, and he felt bitter regret at having
repaid his faithfulness so badly. So King Silverwhite at once rose and
went to the place where his brother was lying. He poured the water of
life from his flask and anointed his brother's wound. In a moment

the hand of the second princess and obtained it. Thereupon the wedding

taking the trips he did, for wherever he sailed he had fair winds, yes,

with it, to suit his wish.

Thus he sailed for many years with cargoes of lumber, and even went as
far as China, and earned money like hay. But once he sailed the North
Sea with all sails set, as though he had stolen ship and cargo. But the
one who was after him sailed even more swiftly. And that was Sir Urian,

go down at once into the ship's hold, and bore two holes in the ship's
bottom. Then they were to take the pumps from out their frames, and set
them closely over the holes, so that the water would rise quite high in
the pipes.

The men were surprised, and thought his orders passing strange, yet they
did as he told them. They bored the holes, and set up the pumps closely

awl. ""Did you not bind yourself in your contract always to keep my ship

take a look at the pumps! The water stands seven feet high in the pipes!
Pump, devil, pump my ship dry, then you may take me to have and to hold
as long as ever you wish!""

The devil was fool enough, and allowed himself to be hoaxed. He worked
and sweat, and the perspiration ran down his cheeks in such streams that
one might have run a mill with them, but he merely kept on pumping out
of the North Sea into the North Sea. At last he had enough of it, and
when he could pump no longer, he flew home to his grandmother to rest.

""And why did you leave her?"" asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex. ""How could you give up such a comfortable place?""",57,firewood,is used for,heating_and_cooking,What do farmers use firewood for?,Farmers use firewood for heating and cooking.

I had bitten the youngest of my master's sons in the leg, because he kicked away the bone I was gnawing. 'Bone for bone,' I thought. But they were so angry, and from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone. Don't you hear how hoarse I am. Away, away! I can't talk any more like other dogs. Away, away, that is the end of it all.""
But the Snow Man was no longer listening. He was looking into the housekeeper's room on the lower storey. Where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself. ""What a strange crackling I feel within me,"" he said. ""Shall I ever get in there? It is an innocent wish, and innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled. I must go in there and lean against her, even if I have to break the window.""
""You must never go in there,"" said the yard-dog, ""for if you approach the stove, you'll melt away, away.""

Snow-man,10,"During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon. No, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed. When the door of the stove was opened, the flames darted out of its mouth. This is customary with all stoves. The light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast of the Snow Man with a ruddy gleam.

In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were covered with ice. They were the most beautiful ice-flowers any Snow Man could desire, but they concealed the stove. These window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being. The snow crackled and the wind whistled around him. It was just the kind of frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly enjoy. But he did not enjoy it.

Away, away,"" he barked and then he added, ""the weather is going to change."" And the weather did change. It began to thaw. As the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased. He said nothing and made no complaint, which is a sure sign. One morning he broke, and sunk down altogether. Behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground. It was the pole round which the boys had built him up. ""Ah, now I understand why he had such a great longing for the stove,"" said the yard-dog. ""Why, there's the shovel that is used for cleaning out the stove, fastened to the pole.""

They would have been quite happy except for one thing: they had no children to play with, and as they were now old people they did not find that watching the children of their neighbours at all made up to them for having one of their own.

One winter, which nobody living will ever forget, the snow lay so deep that it came up to the knees of even the tallest man. When it had all fallen, and the sun was shining again, the children ran out into the street to play, and the old man and his wife sat at their window and gazed at them.

'Yes, let us do that,' said Ivan, and he took down his cap and went into the garden with his old wife.

Then the two set to work with all their might to make a doll out of the snow. They shaped a little body and two little hands and two little feet. On top of all they placed a ball of snow, out of which the head was to be.

While he was still but a little lad, he would do nothing at all; but
was always sitting at the hearth, digging in the ashes. His parents
apprenticed him here and apprenticed him there, to be taught something,
but Halvor never stayed. When he had been anywhere for a few days, he
ran away again, went back home, sat down at the hearth, and dug in the
ashes. But once a master mariner came along and asked whether Halvor

begged the master mariner for permission to go ashore, and look around,
for he would rather do that than lie down and sleep. ""Do you think you
are fit to appear before people?"" asked the master mariner. ""The only
clothes you have are the rags in which you stand and walk!"" Yet Halvor
insisted, and finally he was given permission. But he was to come back
when the wind blew up. Halvor went, and it was a fair land. No matter
where he came, there were great plains, with fields and pastures; but he
saw no people at all. The wind blew up again, but Halvor decided that
he had not yet seen enough, and wanted to go a little further, and see
whether there were no people to be found at all. After a time he came to
a great highway, which was so even one could have rolled an egg along it
with ease. Halvor went on along this highway, and as evening drew near,
he saw a great castle in the distance, that shone afar. Since he had
been wandering all day long, without much in the way of food, he had a
fine appetite; but the nearer he came to the castle, the more frightened
he grew.",124,pasture,is a,grassland,What is a pasture?,A pasture is a field of glassland used for herding.

kitchen, which was beautiful. The kitchenware was all of silver and
gold; but there were no human beings to be seen. After Halvor had waited
a while, and no one came out, he went and opened a door. There he saw a
princess sitting and spinning. ""Alas, no!"" cried she. ""Has a Christian
soul really come here! But it would be best for you to go again, if you

here.""",68,spin,is a,rotate,What does it mean to spin?,To spin means to rotate quickly.

fill, the princess told him to try and see whether he could swing the
sword that hung on the wall. But he could not swing it, nor even raise
it. ""Well,"" said the princess, ""you must take a swallow from the bottle
that hangs beside it, for that is what the troll does when he wants to
use the sword."" Halvor took the swallow, and then could swing the sword
at once as though it were nothing at all. Now, thought he, the troll
could just come along any time. And sure enough, he did come along,
roaring. Halvor placed himself behind the door. ""Hu! it smells like
Christian blood here!"" said the troll, and poked his head in through the
door. ""Yes, you shall find out it is here and at once,"" cried Halvor,
and hewed off all his heads. The princess was filled with joy at her
deliverance, and danced and sang. But then she happened to think of her
sisters, and said: ""If only my sisters could also be delivered!"" ""Where
are they?"" asked Halvor. So she told him that one of them had been
carried off by a troll to a castle six miles further away, and the other
to a castle that lay nine miles away from the other.",105,bottle,is used for,storing_liquids,What do we use bottles for?,We use bottles for storing liquids.

was very strong, so he quickly cleared everything out, cleaned up, and
put all in order. Then they ate, and the following morning he started
off at dawn. He did not rest for a moment, but wandered all day long.
When he spied the castle, he once more felt a little afraid; it was
even handsomer than the other one; but here, too, there was not a human
being to be seen. Then Halvor went into the kitchen, yet did not stop at
all, but stepped right into the next room. ""No, it cannot be possible
that a Christian should venture here!"" cried the princess. ""I do not
know how long I have been here; but during all that time I have not seen
a single Christian soul. It would probably be best if you went away
quickly; for a troll with six heads lives here."" ""No, I am not going,""
said Halvor, ""not even if he had six heads more."" ""He will seize you and
swallow you alive!"" said the princess. But that made no difference,
Halvor would not go, and he did not fear the troll. But he would have to
eat and drink, for he was hungry and thirsty after his long tramp. He
had as much as he wanted; and then the princess wanted to send him away
again. ""No,"" cried Halvor, ""I am not going. I have done no wrong, and
need not fear any one.""",267,thirsty,causes,drink_water,What do we do when we're thirsty?,We drink water when we're thirsty.

try and see whether you can swing the sword that the troll uses in war.""
He could not swing it; but then the princess told him to take a swallow
from the bottle that hung beside it, and when he had done so he could
swing the sword. Suddenly the troll came, and he was so large and so fat
that he had to move sideways in order to get through the door. When he
had thrust in his first head, he cried: ""Huhu! I smell the blood of a
Christian!"" And that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and
then all the rest. The princess was pleased beyond measure; but then she
happened to think of her sisters, and she wished that they also might be
delivered. Halvor thought this might be done, and wanted to start out at
once. But first he had to help the princess get the dead troll out of
the way and then, the following morning, he set out.",117,thrust,has subevent,stick_out,What does it mean to thrust?,To thrust means to stick out the weapon and stab.

to the castle, and he hurried and ran in order to get there in good
time. Toward evening he spied the castle, and it was much handsomer than
both the others. This time he felt hardly any fear at all; but went
through the kitchen and right on in. There sat a princess who was
extraordinarily beautiful. Like the others, she said that no Christian
soul had ever come to the castle since she had been there, and told him
to go away again, as otherwise the troll would swallow him alive, for he
had nine heads. ""And though he had nine more, and nine on top of those,
I will not go,"" said Halvor, and stood by the stove. The princess
earnestly begged him to go, so that the troll would not devour him, but
Halvor said: ""Let him come whenever he wishes!"" Then she gave him the
troll sword, and told him to take a swallow from the bottle, so that he
could swing it.",26,spy,has subevent,monitor,What does it mean to spy?,To spy means to monitor and examine in secret.

trouble to cut it off, though he found himself so very strong.",24,squeeze,has subevent,press,What does it mean to squeeze?,To squeeze means to press from two or more directions at once.
soria-moria-castle,10,"Now all the princesses met at the castle, and were happy as they never
had been before, in all their lives, and they fell in love with Halvor
and he with them, and he was to choose the one whom he loved best; but
it was the youngest who loved him the most of all. Yet Halvor acted
strangely, and grew quite silent and uncommunicative; so the princess
asked him what he was longing for, and whether he did not enjoy being
with them. Yes, he enjoyed it very much, for they had enough to live on,
and he was well enough off, but yet he was homesick, for his parents
were still living, and he would like to see them again. That could
easily be arranged, said the princess. ""You shall go and return without
harm, if you will follow our advice."" Indeed, and he would surely do
nothing against their wishes, said Halvor. Then they dressed him up
until he looked as handsome as a king's son, and put a ring on his
finger that made it possible for the one wearing it to wish himself
away, and back again. But he must not throw the ring away, and he must
not mention their names, said the princesses, otherwise its power would
be gone, all their joy would come to an end, and he would never see them
again.",143,arrange,has subevent,organize,What does it mean to arrange?,To arrange means to organize.

wish was at once realized, and he was standing in front of his parents'
house before he knew it. It was dusk, and when the old folk saw such a
handsome, well-dressed stranger coming, it embarrassed them so that it
seemed as though their bowing and scraping would never end. Halvor now
asked them whether they could not give him a night's lodging. ""No,
they really could not do so, for they were quite unprepared for it,""
said they, ""and we are lacking one thing, and another, which such a
distinguished gentleman would wish to have. It would be best if the
gentleman went up to the castle, whose chimney he can see from here,
where the folk are well prepared."" ""No,"" said Halvor, ""I'll not go there
until to-morrow morning. And now let me stay here overnight. I will be
content to sit by the hearth."" The old folk could make no objection
to this, and so Halvor sat down by the hearth, and began to dig in
the ashes, as he used to when he was the lazybones at home. Then they
chatted about all sorts of matters, and told Halvor about one thing and
another, and finally he asked them whether they had no children. Yes,
they had a son; but did not know whither he had wandered, or even
whether he were still alive, or already dead.",233,lazybones,has context of,slang,What is a lazybone?,A lazybone is the slang for a lazy person.

""No, I am quite sure you could not,"" said the woman, starting up.
""Halvor was so slow and lazy, and never wanted to do anything, and
beside, he was so tattered that one rag got in the way of the other. He
could never have turned into so fine a looking gentleman as yourself.""

After a time the woman had to go to the hearth, and rake the fire, and
as the firelight fell on Halvor, just as it used to when he dug in the
ashes, she recognized him.

""No, can it really be you, Halvor?"" she cried, and then the two old folk
were happy beyond all power of words, and Halvor had to tell all that
had happened to him, while his mother was so pleased with him, that she
wanted to take him up to the castle at once, and show him to the girls
who had always been so proud, and had turned up their noses at her son.
So she went first and Halvor followed. When they came up, she told how
Halvor had come back, and that they ought to see how fine he looked,
just like a prince, said she. ""We can imagine that,"" said the girls, and
tossed their heads. ""He is probably the same ragged fellow that he used
to be.""",201,nose,is capable of,smell_things,What do we use noses for?,We use noses to smell things.

embarrassed that they ran out of the house without their caps. And when
they came in again, they were so ashamed that they did not venture
to look at Halvor, whom they had always treated with such scorn and
contempt. ""Well, you always acted as though you were so fine and
handsome that no one on earth could compare with you. But you ought
to see the oldest princess, whom I delivered,"" said Halvor. ""Compared
to her you look like dairy-maids, and the middle princess is still
handsomer; while the youngest princess, who is my sweetheart, is more
beautiful than the sun and moon. Would to God she were here, so that you
might see her!"" said Halvor.",23,cap,is a,headdress,What is a cap?,A cap is a headdress similar to a hat.

was very much upset, for now he remembered what they had told him.

At the castle they gave a great feast in honor of the princesses, and
made a great deal of them. But they would not stay. ""We want to go to
your parents,"" they said to Halvor, ""and then we want to go out and look
around."" He went with them, and they came to a big sheet of water beyond
the court-yard. Close beside it was a fair green hill, and there the
princesses decided to sit and rest a while, ""for it was so pleasant to
look out over the water,"" said they. They sat down, and after they had
rested a while, the youngest princess said: ""Let me stroke your hair a
little, Halvor!"" Halvor laid his head in her lap, and she stroked his
hair, and before very long Halvor fell asleep. Then she drew the ring
from his finger, and gave him another in place of it, and said: ""All
hold on to me--I wish we were in Soria-Moria Castle!""",110,hill,is a,natural_elevation,What is a hill?,A hill is a natural elevation of land smaller than a mountain.
soria-moria-castle,15,"When Halvor woke up he saw very well that he had lost the princesses,
and began to weep and wail, and was so beside himself with despair that
no one could comfort him. And no matter how hard his parents begged him,
he would not stay at home, but bade them farewell, and said that he
would probably never see them again, for if he did not find his
princesses, then it would not be worth his while to go on living.

He still had three hundred dollars, and these he put in his pocket and
started out. After he had gone a while he met a man with a nice-looking
horse. He decided to buy it, and began to talk with the man. ""It is
true I did not intend to sell the horse,"" said the man, ""but perhaps we
can come to an understanding."" Halvor asked him what he wanted for it.
""I did not pay much for it, nor is it worth very much: it is a good
saddle horse, but as a draft horse it does not amount to much. Yet it
could carry you and your knapsack without difficulty, if you were to
walk a bit from time to time,"" said the man. At last they agreed on the
price, and Halvor slung his knapsack across the horse, and from time to

green hill on which stood a large tree, beneath which he seated himself.
He turned the horse loose, yet did not lie down to sleep, but took out
his knapsack instead. When day came he wandered on again, for it seemed
to him as though there were no place in which he could rest. He walked
and rode all day long through a great forest, in which were many green
clearings, that shimmered cheerfully among the trees. He did not know
where he was, nor did he know whither he was going; but he allowed
himself no more time to rest than his horse needed to feed in one of the
green clearings, and himself to eat from his knapsack. He walked and
rode, on and on, and thought the forest would never end.",87,shimmer,has subevent,shine,What does it mean to shimmer?,To shimmer means to shine.

little, and get something to eat!"" thought Halvor. When he got there it
was a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old couple
sitting in it, as ancient and gray-headed as doves, and the woman had so
long a nose that she used it at the hearth for a poker. ""Good evening!
Good evening!"" said the old woman. ""But what are you doing here? No
Christian soul has come this way for the past hundred years."" Halvor
told her he was looking for Soria-Moria Castle, and asked whether she
knew the way to it. ""No,"" was the woman's answer, ""I do not know, but
here comes the moon, I will ask him. He ought to know, for he shines on
everything."" And then, when the moon rose bright and clear above the
tree-tops, the woman went out. ""You moon, you moon,"" she cried, ""can you
tell me the way to Soria-Moria Castle?"" ""No,"" said the moon, ""I cannot

about in every corner. Well, I declare, you have a horse, too!"" said the
old woman when she came in again. ""Now don't let the poor beast stand
by the door there and starve to death; but take it out to the pasture
instead. Or would you like to change with me? We have a pair of old
boots, that carry you twelve miles further with every step. I will
give them to you in exchange for the horse, and then you will reach
Soria-Moria Castle more quickly."" Halvor at once agreed, and the old
woman was so pleased with the horse, that she almost started dancing
then and there. ""For now I can ride to church, too,"" said she.",33,sweep,has subevent,clean,What does it mean to sweep?,To sweep means to clean with a broom or a brush.

and take a nap, for we have no bed for you,"" said she. ""I will watch for
the West Wind's coming.""

All of a sudden the West Wind came rushing along so that the walls
creaked. The woman ran out: ""You West Wind! You West Wind! Can you tell
me the way to Soria-Moria Castle? There is a fellow here who wants to
know."" ""Yes, indeed,"" said the West Wind, ""I have to go to that very
place, and dry the wash for the wedding soon to be held. If he is quick
afoot, he may come along with me."" Halvor ran out. ""You must hurry if
you are going with me,"" said the West Wind; and at once he was up and
off over hill and dale, land and sea, so that Halvor could hardly keep
up with him. ""Now I have no more time to keep you company,"" said the
West Wind, ""because I have first to tear down a stretch of pine forest,
before I come to the bleaching-field and dry the wash. But if you keep
going along the hills, you will meet some girls standing there and
washing, and then you will not be far from Soria-Moria Castle.""",193,dale,is a,valley,What is a dale?,A dale is a vally.

tearing down a stretch of pine forest, and will soon be here,"" and then
he asked the way to Soria-Moria Castle. They showed it to him, and when
he reached the castle it was fairly alive with men and horses. But

lad, and did not mind lending a hand when need arose; then, too, he did
as much work as an able seaman, and was so full of fun that he kept the
whole crew in good humor. And so the captain did not like to lose him.
But the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the
blue pond in the fall; though he was willing to stay on board till
the ship was loaded and ready to sail. One Sunday, while the crew was
ashore, and the captain had gone to a farm-holding near the forest, in
order to bargain for small timber and log wood--presumably on his own
account--for a deck load, the youth had been left to guard the ship.

single day--the captain and crew should know which day it was to be in
advance--then he would set foot on the ship no more, and far less would
he ever dirty his hands with pitch and tar on her again. The whole thing
seemed strange to the captain, yet he finally gave in, because he wanted
to have the boy along with him and, no doubt, he also thought that
he would come to his senses again when they were once under way. The
quartermaster was of the same opinion. ""Just let him command all he

not laugh; but cast out the birch-wood billet by billet. When the last
billet fell they heard a groaning, as though some one were wrestling
with death, and then the squall had passed.

what had been left of the topsails. The second squall hit them with even
greater force than the first, and was so vicious and violent that the
whole crew was frightened. While it was at its worst, the boy told them
to throw overboard the second cord; and they threw it over billet by
billet, and took care not to take any from the third cord. When the last
billet fell, they again heard a deep groan, and then all was still. ""Now
there will be one more squall, and that will be the worst,"" said the
boy, and sent every one to his station. There was not a hawser loose on
the whole ship.

The wicked old man returned to his home with an evil smile on his face. He told his wife how he had succeeded in his crafty intentions.

They had been married by their respective families according to Japanese custom when very young, and had lived together happily ever since. They had, however, one cause for great sorrow, for as the years went by no child was born to them. This made them very unhappy, for they both longed to see a child of their own who would grow up to gladden their old age, carry on the family name, and keep up the ancestral rites when they were dead. The Prince and his lovely wife, after long consultation and much thought, determined to make a pilgrimage to the temple of Hase-no-Kwannon (Goddess of Mercy at Hase). They believed, according to the beautiful tradition of their religion, that the Mother of Mercy, Kwannon, comes to answer the prayers of mortals in the form that they need the most. Surely after all these years of prayer she would come to them in the form of a beloved child in answer to their special pilgrimage, for that was the greatest need of their two lives.

A daughter was born at last to the Princess Murasaki, and great was the joy of her heart.

If so do not grieve for me, but look upon your father's second wife as your true mother, and be obedient and filial to both her and your father.

To make matters worse the Emperor sent many beautiful gifts to the little Princess to reward her for playing so well at the Palace.

There was also now another reason why Princess Terute hated her step-daughter, for she had had the good fortune to have a son born to her, and in her inmost heart she kept saying:

winter home, and under its ample shadow the wife fixed the lodge, while
the husband went out to hunt. Early in the evening he returned with a
deer, and, being weary and athirst, he asked his son, whom he called
Strong Desire, to go to the river for some water. The son replied that

looking up at the stars, and sighing like one sorely distressed.

The next day he asked his mother to dress the skin of the deer, and to
make it into moccasins for him, while he busied himself in preparing a
bow and arrows.

As soon as these were in readiness, he left the lodge one morning, at
sunrise, without saying a word to his father or mother. As he passed

He approached a little nearer, and concealed himself; and in a moment he discovered that the figure was no other than that of the terrible witch, the little old woman who makes war. Her path to the lake was perfectly smooth and solid, and the noise Strong Desire had heard was caused by the striking of her walking staff upon the ground.

After laying by the cloak, she came directly to him. Looking at him steadily, she informed him that she had known him from the time he had left his father's lodge, and had watched his movements. She told him not to fear or despair, for she would be his protector and friend. She invited him into her lodge, and gave him a supper.

His hair being very short, she took a great leaden comb, and after drawing it through his locks several times, they became of a handsome length like those of a beautiful young woman. She then proceeded to dress him as a female, furnishing him with the necessary garments, and tinting his face with colors of the most charming dye.",165,female,is capable of,bear_young,Which gender is able to bear the young?,The female.
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,7,"She gave him, too, a bowl of shining metal. She directed him to put in his girdle a blade of scented sword-grass, and to proceed the next morning to the banks of the lake, which was no other than that over which the Red Head reigned. Now Hah-Undo-Tah, or the Red Head, was a most powerful sorcerer, living upon an island in the centre of his realm of water, and he was the terror of all the country. She informed him that there would be many Indians upon the island, who, as soon as they saw him use the shining bowl to drink with, would come and solicit him to be their wife, and to take him over to the island. These offers he was to refuse, and to say that he had come a great distance to be the wife of the Red Head, and that if the chief could not seek her for himself, she would return to her village. She said, that as soon as the Red Head heard of this he would come for her in his own canoe, in which she must embark.",21,blade,is used for,cut,What is the blade?,"The part of a knife, sword, razor, or other tool with which it cuts."

She also gave Strong Desire general advice how he was to conduct himself to sustain his assumed character of a woman. His fear would scarcely permit him to consent to engage in an adventure attended with so much danger; but the recollection of his father's looks and reproaches of the want of courage, decided him.

Early in the morning he left the lodge of the little old woman who makes war, which was clouded in a heavy brackish fog, so thick and heavy to breathe, that he with difficulty made his way forth. When he turned to look back for it, it was gone.

He took the hard beaten path to the banks of the lake, and made for the water at a point directly opposite the Red Head's lodge.",99,adventure,is a,undertaking,What is inevitable in the adventure?,The undertaking of risks.
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,9,"Where he now stood it was beautiful day. The heavens were clear, and the sun shone out as brightly to Strong Desire as on the first morning when he had put forth his little head from the door of his father's lodge. He had not been long there, sauntering along the beach, when he displayed the glittering bowl by dipping water from the lake. Very soon a number of canoes came off from the island. The men admired his dress, and were charmed with his beauty, and almost with one voice they all made proposals of marriage. These, Strong Desire promptly declined.

When this was reported to Red Head, he ordered his royal bark to be launched by his chosen men of the oar, and crossed over to see this wonderful girl. As they approached the shore, Strong Desire saw that the ribs of the sorcerer's canoe were formed of living rattlesnakes, whose heads pointed outward to guard him from his enemies. Being invited, he had no sooner stepped into the canoe, than they began to hiss and rattle furiously, which put him in a great fright; but the magician spoke to them, when they became pacified and quiet. Shortly after they were at the landing upon the island. The marriage took place immediately; and the bride made presents of various valuables which had been furnished her by the old witch who inhabited the cloudy lodge.",221,pacify,has subevent,calm,How to make people calm?,By pacifying them.
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,10,"As they were sitting in the lodge, surrounded by the friends and relatives, the mother of the Red Head regarded the face of her new daughter-in-law for a long time with fixed attention. From this scrutiny she was convinced that this singular and hasty marriage boded no good to her son. She drew him aside, and disclosed to him her suspicions. This can be no female, said she; she has the figure and manners, the countenance, and more especially the eyes, are beyond a doubt those of a man. Her husband rejected her suspicions, and rebuked her severely for entertaining such notions of her own daughter-in-law. She still urged her doubts, which so vexed the husband that he broke his pipe-stem in her face, and called her an owl.

This act astonished the company, who sought an explanation; and it was no sooner given, than the mock bride, rising with an air of offended dignity, informed the Red Head that after receiving so gross an affront from his relatives she could not think of remaining with him as his wife, but should forthwith return to her own friends.",44,singular,has property,one,What is singular?,Being only one of a larger population.
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,11,"With a toss of the head, like that of an angry female, Strong Desire left the lodge, followed by Red Head, and walked away until he came to the beach of the island, near the spot where they had first landed. Red Head entreated him to remain, urging every motive, and making all sorts of magnificent promises-none of which seemed to make the least impression. Strong Desire, Red Head thought, was very hard-hearted. During these appeals they had seated themselves upon the ground, and Red Head, in great affliction, reclined his head upon his fancied wife's lap. Strong Desire now changed his manner, was very kind and soothing, and suggested in the most winning accent that if Red Head would sleep soundly for awhile he might possibly dream himself out of all his troubles. Red Head, delighted at so happy a prospect, said that he would fall asleep immediately.

""You have killed a good many men in your time, Red Head,"" said Strong Desire, by way of suggesting an agreeable train of ideas to the sorcerer.

""Hundreds,"" answered Red Head; ""and what is better, now that I am fairly settled in life by this happy marriage, I shall be able to give my whole attention to massacre.""",235,able,is the antonym of,unable,What is the opposite of able?,Unable.
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,12,"""And you will kill hundreds more,"" interposed Strong Desire, in the most insinuating manner imaginable.

""Just so, my dear,"" Red Head replied, with a great leer; ""thousands. There will be no end to my delicious murders. I love dearly to kill people. I would like to kill you if you were not my wife.""

""There, there,"" said Strong Desire, with the coaxing air of a little coquette, ""go to sleep; that's a good Red Head.""

No other subject of conversation occurring to the chief, now that he had exhausted the delightful topic of wholesale murder, he straightway fell into a deep sleep.

The chance so anxiously sought for had come; and Strong Desire, with a smiling eye, drawing his blade of grass with lightning swiftness once across the neck of the Red Head, severed the huge and wicked head from the body.

In a moment, stripping off his woman's dress, underneath which he had all along worn his male attire, Strong Desire seized the bleeding trophy, plunged into the lake, and swam safely over to the main shore. He had scarcely reached it, when, looking back, he saw amid the darkness the torches of persons come out in search of the new married couple. He listened until they had found the headless body, and he heard their piercing shrieks of rage and sorrow as he took his way to the lodge of his kind adviser.",202,seize,has subevent,take,What is seize?,To deliberately take hold of.
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,13,"The little old woman who makes war was in an excellent humor, and she received Strong Desire with rejoicing. She admired his prudence, and assured him his bravery should never be questioned again. Lifting up the head, which she gazed upon with vast delight, she said he need only have brought the scalp. Cutting off a lock of the hair for herself, she told him he might now return with the head, which would be evidence of an achievement that would cause his own people to respect him.

""In your way home,"" added the little old woman, ""you will meet with but one difficulty. Maunkahkeesh, the Spirit of the Earth, requires an offering or sacrifice from all of her sons who perform extraordinary deeds. As you walk along in a prairie there will be an earthquake; the earth will open and divide the prairie in the middle. Take this partridge and throw it into the opening, and instantly spring over it.""

With many thanks to the little old witch, who had so faithfully befriended him, Strong Desire took leave of her, and having, by the course pointed out, safely passed the earthquake, he arrived near his own village. He secretly hid his precious trophy.",16,strong,causes,eat_healthily,How to keep the body strong?,By eating healthily.
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,14,"On entering the village, he found that his parents had returned from the place of their spring encampment by the wood-side, and that they were in heavy sorrowing for their son, whom they supposed to be lost. One and another of the young men had presented themselves to the disconsolate parents, and said, ""Look up, I am your son;"" but when they looked up, they beheld not the familiar face of Strong Desire.

Having been often deceived in this manner, when their own son in truth presented himself they sat with their heads down, and with their eyes nearly blinded with weeping. It was some time before they could be prevailed upon to bestow a glance upon him. It was still longer before they could recognize him as their son who had refused to draw water from the river, at night, for fear, for his countenance was no longer that of a timid stripling; it was that of a man who has seen and done great things, and who has the heart to do greater still.",113,blind,has subevent,darken,What will happen if a person is blinded?,Their world will be darkened.
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,15,"When he recounted his adventures they believed him mad. The young men laughed at him-him, Strong Desire-who feared to walk to the river at night-time.

He left the lodge, and ere their laughter had ceased, returned with his trophy. He held aloft the head of the Red Sorcerer, with the great ghastly leer which lighted it up before his last sleep, at prospect of a thousand future murders, fresh upon it. It was easily recognized, and the young men who had scoffed at Strong Desire shrunk into the corners out of sight. Strong Desire had conquered the terrible Red Head! All doubts of the truth of his adventures were dispelled.

He was greeted with joy, and placed among the first warriors of the nation. He finally became a chief, and his family were ever after respected and esteemed.",135,warrior,is capable of,fight_battle,What should a warrior do?,They should fight in a battle.

nailed against it with four nails. When he touched the fish, the
latter turned into a handsome youth, who thanked him for delivering
him, and they agreed to regard each other as brothers. Soon the first
youth grew very hungry. He stepped out in front of the cave to search
for food, but only stones were lying there. Then, suddenly, he saw a
great dragon, who was licking a stone. The youth imitated him, and
before long his hunger had disappeared. He next asked the dragon how
he could get away from the cave, and the dragon nodded his head in the

tortoise-shell, and put them in his pocket. Not long after he reached
the sea-shore. Here he flung a pearl into the sea, and at once the
waters divided and he could see the sea-dragon. The sea-dragon cried:

reward, and the youth answered: ""I want no money, nor any jewels. All

ass, waiting for him, on which he mounted. After he had ridden for a
while, the ass's gait seemed too uneven, and along came a wagon, into
which he climbed. But the wagon shook him up too, greatly, and he
thought: ""If I only had a litter! That would suit me better."" No more

the-black-bull-of-norroway,1,"In bygone days, long centuries ago, there lived a widowed Queen who had
three daughters. And this widowed Queen was so poor, and had fallen upon
such evil days, that she and her daughters had often much ado to get
enough to eat.

So the eldest Princess determined that she would set out into the world
to seek her fortune. And her mother was quite willing that she should do
so. ""For,"" said she, ""It is better to work abroad than to starve at
home.""

But as there was an old hen-wife living near the Castle who was said to
be a witch, and to be able to foretell the future, the Queen sent the
Princess to her cottage, before she set out on her travels, to ask her
in which of the Four Airts she ought to go, in order to find the best
fortune.

""Thou needst gang nae farther than my back door, hinnie,"" answered the
old Dame, who had always felt very sorry for the Queen and her pretty
daughters, and was glad to do them a good turn.",95,starve,has subevent,die,What could happen if someone starve for a long time?,They could die.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,2,"So the Princess ran through the passage to the hen-wife's back door and
peeped out, and what should she see but a magnificent coach, drawn by
six beautiful cream-coloured horses, coming along the road.

Greatly excited at this unusual sight, she hurried back to the kitchen,
and told the hen-wife what she had seen.

""Aweel, aweel, ye've seen your fortune,"" said the old woman, in a tone
of satisfaction, ""for that coach-and-six is coming for thee.""

Sure enough, the coach-and-six stopped at the gate of the Castle, and
the second Princess came running down to the cottage to tell her sister
to make haste, because it was waiting for her. Delighted beyond measure
at the wonderful luck that had come to her, she hurried home, and,
saying farewell to her mother and sisters, took her seat within, and the
horses galloped off immediately.",32,horse,is capable of,pull_cart,What can horses do?,Horses can pull carts.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,3,"And I've heard tell that they drew her to the Palace of a great and
wealthy Prince, who married her; but that is outside my story.

A few weeks afterwards, the second Princess thought that she would do as
her sister had done, and go down to the hen-wife's cottage, and tell her
that she, too, was going out into the world to seek her fortune. And, of
course, in her heart of hearts she hoped that what had happened to her
sister would happen to her also.

And, curious to say, it did. For the old hen-wife sent her to look out
at her back door, and she went, and, lo and behold! another
coach-and-six was coming along the road. And when she went and told the
old woman, she smiled upon her kindly, and told her to hurry home, for
the coach-and-six was her fortune also, and that it had come for her.

So she, too, ran home, and got into her grand carriage, and was driven
away. And, of course, after all these lucky happenings, the youngest
Princess was anxious to try what her fortune might be; so the very
night, in high good humour, she tripped away down to the old witch's
cottage.",16,wealthy,is the antonym of,poor,What is the opposite of wealthy?,Poor.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,4,"She, too, was told to look out at the back door, and she was only too
glad to do so; for she fully expected to see a third coach-and-six
coming rolling along the high road, straight for the Castle door.

But, alas and alack! no such sight greeted her eager eyes, for the high
road was quite deserted, and in great disappointment she ran back to the
hen-wife to tell her so.

""Then it is clear that thy fortune is not coming to meet thee this day,""
said the old Dame, ""so thou must e'en come back to-morrow.""

So the little Princess went home again, and next day she turned up
once more at the old wife's cottage.",66,desert,has subevent,leave,What does it mean to be deserted?,It means to be left unwatched and uncultivated.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,5,"But once more she was disappointed, for although she looked out long and
eagerly, no glad sight of a coach-and-six, or of any other coach,
greeted her eyes. On the third day, however, what should she see but a
great Black Bull coming rushing along the road, bellowing as it came,
and tossing its head fiercely in the air.

In great alarm, the little Princess shut the door, and ran to the
hen-wife to tell her about the furious animal that was approaching.

""Hech, hinnie,"" cried the old woman, holding up her hands in dismay,
""and who would have thocht that the Black Bull of Norroway wad be your
fate!""

At the words, the poor little maiden grew pale. She had come out to seek
her fortune, but it had never dawned upon her that her fortune could be
anything so terrible as this.",71,alarm,is a,signal,What is an alarm?,An alarm is a signal for warning.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,6,"""But the Bull cannot be my fortune,"" she cried in terror. ""I cannot go

""But ye'll need tae,"" replied the hen-wife calmly. ""For you lookit out
of my door with the intent of meeting your fortune; and when your
fortune has come tae ye, you must just thole it.""

And when the poor Princess ran weeping to her mother, to beg to be
allowed to stay at home, she found her mother of the same mind as the
Wise Woman; and so she had to allow herself to be lifted up on to the
back of the enormous Black Bull that had come up to the door of the
Castle, and was now standing there quietly enough. And when she was
settled, he set off again on his wild career, while she sobbed and
trembled with terror, and clung to his horns with all her might.

On and on they went, until at last the poor maiden was so faint with
fear and hunger that she could scarce keep her seat.",14,terror,is a,strong_emotion,What is terror?,Terror is a strong emotion of fear.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,7,"Just as she was losing her hold of the great beast's horns, however, and
feeling that she must fall to the ground, he turned his massive head
round a little, and, speaking in a wonderfully soft and gentle voice,
said: ""Eat out of my right ear, and drink out of my left ear, so wilt
thou be refreshed for thy journey.""

So the Princess put a trembling hand into the Bull's right ear, and drew
out some bread and meat, which, in spite of her terror, she was glad to
swallow; then she put her hand into his left ear, and found there a tiny
flagon of wine, and when she had drunk that, her strength returned to
her in a wonderful way.

Long they went, and sore they rode, till, just as it seemed to the
Princess that they must be getting near the World's End, they came in
sight of a magnificent Castle.

""That's where we maun bide this night,"" said the Black Bull of Norroway,
""for that is the house of one of my brothers.""",125,flagon,is a,vessel,What is a flagon?,A flagon is a large vessel resembling a jug.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,8,"The Princess was greatly surprised at these words; but by this time she
was too tired to wonder very much at anything, so she did not answer,
but sat still where she was, until the Bull ran into the courtyard of
the Castle and knocked his great head against the door.


The door was opened at once by a very splendid footman, who treated the
Black Bull with great respect, and helped the Princess to alight from
his back. Then he ushered her into a magnificent hall, where the Lord of
the Castle, and his Lady, and a great and noble company were assembled;
while the Black Bull trotted off quite contentedly to the grassy park
which stretched all round the building, to spend the night there.

The Lord and his Lady were very kind to the Princess, and gave her her
supper, and led her to a richly furnished bedroom, all hung round with
golden mirrors, and left her to rest there; and in the morning, just as
the Black Bull came trotting up to the front door, they handed her a
beautiful apple, telling her not to break it, but to put it in her
pocket, and keep it till she was in the greatest strait that mortal
could be in. Then she was to break it, and it would bring her out of it.",231,strait,is a,channel,What is a strait?,A strait is a narrow water channel.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,9,"So she put the apple in her pocket, and they lifted her once more on to
the Black Bull's back, and she and her strange companion continued on
their journey.

All that day they travelled, far further than I can tell you, and at
night they came in sight of another Castle, which was even bigger and
grander than the first.

""That's where we maun bide this night,"" said the Black Bull, ""for that
is the home of another of my brothers.""

And here the Princess rested for the night in a very fine bedroom
indeed, all hung with silken curtains; and the Lord and Lady of the
Castle did everything to please her and make her comfortable.",117,curtain,is used for,cover_window,What do we use to cover windows?,We use curtains to cover windows.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,10,"And in the morning, before she left, they presented her with the largest
pear that she had ever seen, and warned her that she must not break it
until she was in the direst strait that she had ever been in, and then,
if she broke it, it would bring her out of it.

The third day was the same as the other two had been. The Princess and
the Black Bull of Norroway rode many a weary mile, and at sundown they
came to another Castle, more splendid by far than the other two.

This Castle belonged to the Black Bull's youngest brother, and here the
Princess abode all night; while the Bull, as usual, lay outside in the
park. And this time, when they departed, the Princess received a most
lovely plum, with the warning not to break it till she was in the
greatest strait that mortal could be in. Then she was to break it, and
it would set her free.

On the fourth day, however, things were changed. For there was no fine
Castle waiting for them at the end of their journey; on the contrary, as
the shadows began to lengthen, they came to a dark, deep glen, which was
so gloomy and so awesome-looking that the poor Princess felt her courage
sinking as they approached it.",252,approach,has subevent,advance,What does it mean to approach?,To approach means to advance nearer.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,11,"At the entrance the Black Bull stopped. ""Light down here, Lady,"" he
said, ""for in this glen a deadly conflict awaits me, which I must face
unaided and alone. For the dark and gloomy region that lies before us is
the abode of a great Spirit of Darkness, who worketh much ill in the
world. I would fain fight with him and overcome him; and, by my troth,
I have good hope that I shall do so. As for thee, thou must seat thyself
on this stone, and stir neither hand, nor foot, nor tongue till I
return. For, if thou but so much as move, then the Evil Spirit of the
Glen will have thee in his power.""

""But how shall I know what is happening to thee?"" asked the Princess
anxiously, for she was beginning to grow quite fond of the huge black
creature that had carried her so gallantly these last four days, ""if I
have neither to move hand nor foot, nor yet to speak.""

""Thou wilt know by the signs around thee,"" answered the Bull. ""For if
everything about thee turn blue, then thou wilt know that I have
vanquished the Evil Spirit; but if everything about thee turn red, then
the Evil Spirit hath vanquished me.""

With these words he departed, and was soon lost to sight in the dark
recesses of the glen, leaving the little Princess sitting motionless on
her stone, afraid to move so much as her little finger, in case some
unknown evil fell upon her.",23,glen,is a,valley,What is a glen?,A glen is a valley.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,12,"At last, when she had sat there for well-nigh an hour, a curious change
began to pass over the landscape. First it turned grey, and then it
turned a deep azure blue, as if the sky had descended on the earth.

""The Bull hath conquered,"" thought the Princess. ""Oh! what a noble
animal he is!"" And in her relief and delight she moved her position and
crossed one leg over the other.

Oh, woe-a-day! In a moment a mystic spell fell upon her, which caused
her to become invisible to the eyes of the Prince of Norroway, who,
having vanquished the Evil Spirit, was loosed from the spell which had
lain over him, and had transformed him into the likeness of a great
Black Bull, and who returned in haste down the glen to present himself,
in his rightful form, to the maiden whom he loved, and whom he hoped to
win for his bride.

Long, long he sought, but he could not find her, while all the time she
was sitting patiently waiting on the stone; but the spell was on her
eyes also, and hindered her seeing him, as it hindered him seeing her.",63,noble,is the antonym of,ignoble,What is the opposite of noble?,Ignoble.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,13,"So she sat on and on, till at last she became so wearied, and lonely,
and frightened, that she burst out crying, and cried herself to sleep;
and when she woke in the morning she felt that it was no use sitting
there any longer, so she rose and took her way, hardly knowing whither
she was going.

And she went, and she went, till at last she came to a great hill made
all of glass, which blocked her way and prevented her going any further.
She tried time after time to climb it, but it was all of no avail, for
the surface of the hill was so slippery that she only managed to climb
up a few feet, to slide down again the next moment.

So she began to walk round the bottom of the hill, in the hope of
finding some path that would lead her over it, but the hill was so big,
and she was so tired, that it seemed almost a hopeless quest, and her
spirit died completely within her. And as she went slowly along, sobbing
with despair, she felt that if help did not come soon she must lie down
and die.

About mid-day, however, she came to a little cottage, and beside the
cottage there was a smithy, where an old smith was working at his anvil.",138,slide,is at location of,park,Where can we find a slide?,We can find slides in a children's park.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,14,"She entered, and asked him if he could tell her of any path that would
lead her over the mountain. The old man laid down his hammer and looked
at her, slowly shaking his head as he did so.

""Na, na, lassie,"" he said, ""there is no easy road over the Mountain of
Glass. Folk maun either walk round it, which is not an easy thing to do,
for the foot of it stretches out for hundreds of miles, and the folk who
try to do so are almost sure to lose their way; or they maun walk over
the top of it, and that can only be done by those who are shod with iron
shoon.""

""And how am I to get these iron shoon?"" cried the Princess eagerly.
""Couldst thou fashion me a pair, good man? I would gladly pay thee for
them."" Then she stopped suddenly, for she remembered that she had no
money.

""These shoon cannot be made for siller,"" said the old man solemnly.
""They can only be earned by service. I alone can make them, and I make
them for those who are willing to serve me.""",28,hammer,is used for,hit_nail,What do we use hammers for?,We use hammers to hit nails.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,15,"""And how long must I serve thee ere thou makest them for me?"" asked the
Princess faintly.

""Seven years,"" replied the old man, ""for they be magic shoon, and that
is the magic number.""

So, as there seemed nothing else for it, the Princess hired herself to
the smith for seven long years: to clean his house, and cook his food,
and make and mend his clothes.

At the end of that time he fashioned her a pair of iron shoon, with
which she climbed the Mountain of Glass with as much ease as if it had
been covered with fresh green turf.

When she had reached the summit, and descended to the other side, the
first house that she came to was the house of an old washerwoman, who
lived there with her only daughter. And as the Princess was now very
tired, she went up to the door, and knocked, and asked if she might be
allowed to rest there for the night.",128,summit,is at location of,top_of_mountain,What is a summit?,A summit is the top of a mountain.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,16,"The washerwoman, who was old and ugly, with a sly and evil face, said
that she might--on one condition--and that was that she should try to
wash a white mantle that the Black Knight of Norroway had brought to her
to wash, as he had got it stained in a deadly fight.

""Yestreen I spent the lee-long day washing it,"" went on the old Dame,
""and I might as well have let it lie on the table. For at night, when I
took it out of the wash-tub, the stains were there as dark as ever.
Peradventure, maiden, if thou wouldst try thy hand upon it thou mightest
be more successful. For I am loth to disappoint the Black Knight of
Norroway, who is an exceeding great and powerful Prince.""

""Is he in any way connected with the Black Bull of Norroway?"" asked the
Princess; for at the name her heart had leaped for joy, for it seemed
that mayhap she was going to find once more him whom she had lost.",180,leap,is a,jump,What does it mean to leap?,To leap means to jump.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,17,"The old woman looked at her suspiciously. ""The two are one,"" she
answered; ""for the Black Knight chanced to have a spell thrown over him,
which turned him into a Black Bull, and which could not be lifted until
he had fought with, and overcome, a mighty Spirit of Evil that lived in
a dark glen. He fought with the Spirit, and overcame it and once more
regained his true form; but it is said that his mind is somewhat clouded
at times, for he speaketh ever of a maiden whom he would fain have
wedded, and whom he hath lost. Though who, or what she was, no living
person kens. But this story can have no interest to a stranger like
thee,"" she added slowly, as if she were sorry for having said so much.
""I have no more time to waste in talking. But if thou wilt try and wash
the mantle, thou art welcome to a night's lodging; and if not, I must
ask thee to go on thy way.""

Needless to say, the Princess said that she would try to wash the
mantle; and it seemed as if her fingers had some magic power in them,
for as soon as she put it into water the stains vanished, and it became
as white and clean as when it was new.

Of course, the old woman was delighted, but she was very suspicious
also, for it appeared to her that there must be some mysterious link
between the maiden and the Knight, if his mantle became clean so easily
when she washed it, when it had remained soiled and stained in spite of
all the labour which she and her daughter had bestowed upon it.",136,interest,is a,curiosity,What is interest?,Interest is an emotion of curiosity.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,18,"So, as she knew that the young Gallant intended returning for it that
very night, and as she wanted her daughter to get the credit of washing
it, she advised the Princess to go to bed early, in order to get a good
night's rest after all her labours. And the Princess followed her
advice, and thus it came about that she was sound asleep, safely hidden
in the big box-bed in the corner, when the Black Knight of Norroway came
to the cottage to claim his white mantle.

Now you must know that the young man had carried about this mantle with
him for the last seven years--ever since his encounter with the Evil
Spirit of the Glen--always trying to find someone who could wash it for
him, and never succeeding.

For it had been revealed to him by a wise woman that she who could make
it white and clean was destined to be his wife--be she bonnie or ugly,
old or young. And that, moreover, she would prove a loving, a faithful,
and a true helpmeet.

So when he came to the washerwoman's cottage, and received back his
mantle white as the driven snow, and heard that it was the washerwoman's
daughter who had wrought this wondrous change, he said at once that he
would marry her, and that the very next day.",94,claim,is a,demand,What is a claim?,A claim is a demand of ownership made for something.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,19,"When the Princess awoke in the morning and heard all that had befallen,
and how the Black Knight had come to the cottage while she was asleep,
and had received his mantle, and had promised to marry the washerwoman's
daughter that very day, her heart was like to break. For now she felt
that she never would have the chance of speaking to him and telling him
who she really was.

And in her sore distress she suddenly remembered the beautiful fruit
which she had received on her journey seven long years before, and which
she had carried with her ever since.

""Surely I will never be in a sorer strait than I am now,"" she said to
herself; and she drew out the apple and broke it. And, lo and behold! it
was filled with the most beautiful precious stones that she had ever
seen; and at the sight of them a plan came suddenly into her head.

She took the precious stones out of the apple, and, putting them into a
corner of her kerchief, carried them to the washerwoman.

""See,"" said she, ""I am richer than mayhap thou thoughtest I was. And if
thou wilt, all these riches may be thine.""",94,journey,is a,travel,What is a journey?,A journey is a set amount of travelling.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,20,"""And how could that come about?"" asked the old woman eagerly, for she
had never seen so many precious stones in her life before, and she had a
great desire to become the possessor of them.

""Only put off thy daughter's wedding for one day,"" replied the Princess.
""And let me watch beside the Black Knight as he sleeps this night, for I
have long had a great desire to see him.""

To her astonishment the washerwoman agreed to this request; for the wily
old woman was very anxious to get the jewels, which would make her rich
for life, and it did not seem to her that there was any harm in the
Princess's request; for she had made up her mind that she would give the
Black Knight a sleeping-draught, which would effectually prevent him as
much as speaking to this strange maiden.",95,request,has subevent,ask,What is a request?,A request is a speech act of asking for something.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,21,"So she took the jewels and locked them up in her kist, and the wedding
was put off, and that night the little Princess slipped into the Black
Knight's apartment when he was asleep, and watched all through the long
hours by his bedside, singing this song to him in the hope that he would
awake and hear it:

    ""Seven lang years I served for thee,
    The glassy hill I clamb for thee.
    The mantle white I washed for thee,
    And wilt thou no waken, and turn to me?""

But although she sang it over and over again, as if her heart would
burst, he neither listened nor stirred, for the old washerwoman's potion
had made sure of that.

Next morning, in her great trouble, the little Princess broke open the
pear, hoping that its contents would help her better than the contents
of the apple had done. But in it she found just what she had found
before--a heap of precious stones; only they were richer and more
valuable than the others had been.",117,burst,has subevent,break,What does it mean to burst?,To burst means to break from internal pressure.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,22,"So, as it seemed the only thing to do, she carried them to the old
woman, and bribed her to put the wedding off for yet another day, and
allow her to watch that night also by the Black Prince's bedside.

And the washerwoman did so; ""for,"" said she, as she locked away the
stones, ""I shall soon grow quite rich at this rate.""

But, alas! it was all in vain that the Princess spent the long hours
singing with all her might:

    ""Seven lang years I served for thee,
    The glassy hill I clamb for thee,
    The mantle white I washed for thee,
    And wilt thou no waken, and turn to me?""

for the young Prince whom she watched so tenderly, remained deaf and
motionless as a stone.",33,allow,has subevent,permit,What does it mean to allow?,To allow means to permit.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,23,"By the morning she had almost lost hope, for there was only the plum
remaining now, and if that failed her last chance had gone. With
trembling fingers she broke it open, and found inside another
collection of precious stones, richer and rarer than all the others.

She ran with these to the washerwoman, and, throwing them into her lap,
told her she could keep them all and welcome if she would put off the
wedding once again, and let her watch by the Prince for one more night.
And, greatly wondering, the old woman consented.

Now it chanced that the Black Knight, tired with waiting for his
wedding, went out hunting that day with all his attendants behind him.
And as the servants rode they talked together about something that had
puzzled them sorely these two nights gone by. At last an old huntsman
rode up to the Knight, with a question upon his lips.",29,tremble,has subevent,shake,What does it mean to tremble?,To tremble means to shake out of fear or coldness.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,24,"""Master,"" he said, ""we would fain ken who the sweet singer is who
singeth through the night in thy chamber?""

""Singer!"" he repeated. ""There is no singer. My chamber hath been as quiet
as the grave, and I have slept a dreamless sleep ever since I came to
live at the cottage.""

The old huntsman shook his head. ""Taste not the old wife's draught this
night, Master,"" he said earnestly; ""then wilt thou hear what other ears
have heard.""

At other times the Black Knight would have laughed at his words, but
to-day the man spoke with such earnestness that he could not but listen
to them. So that evening, when the washerwoman, as was her wont, brought
his sleeping-draught of spiced ale to his bedside, he told her that it
was not sweet enough for his liking. And when she turned and went to the
kitchen to fetch some honey to sweeten it, he jumped out of bed and
poured it all out of the window, and when she came back he pretended
that he had drunk it.",153,ale,is a,beer,What is ale?,Ale is a type of beer made without hops.
the-black-bull-of-norroway,25,"So it came to pass that he lay awake that night and heard the Princess
enter his room, and listened to her plaintive little song, sung in a
voice that was full of sobs:

    ""Seven lang years I served for thee,
    The glassy hill I clamb for thee,
    The mantle white I washed for thee,
    And wilt thou no waken, and turn to me?""

And when he heard it, he understood it all; and he sprang up and took
her in his arms and kissed her, and asked her to tell him the whole
story.

And when he heard it, he was so angry with the old washerwoman and her
deceitful daughter that he ordered them to leave the country at once;
and he married the little Princess, and they lived happily all their
days.",35,sob,has subevent,cry,What does it mean to sob?,"To sob means to cry with short, sudden expulsions of breath."

the-bones-of-djulung,2,"'I should like him for a pet,' thought the girl. The next time the
fish swam by, she put out her hand and caught him. Then she ran along
the grassy path till she came to a cave in front of which a stream fell
over some rocks into a basin. Here she put her little fish, whose name
was Djulung-djulung, and promising to return soon and bring him some
dinner. She went away.

By the time she got home, the rice for their dinner was ready cooked. The eldest sister gave the other six their portions in wooden bowls.
But the youngest did not finish hers, and when no one was looking, stole
off to the fountain in the forest where the little fish was swimming
about.

'See! I have not forgotten you,' she cried. One by one she let
the grains of rice fall into the water, where the fish gobbled them up
greedily. He had never tasted anything so nice.

'That is all for to-day,' she said at last, 'but I will come again
to-morrow,' and biding him good-bye she went down the path.

Now the girl did not tell her sisters about the fish, but every day she
saved half of her rice to give him, and called him softly in a little
song she had made for herself. If she sometimes felt hungry, no one knew
of it, and, indeed, she did not mind that much, when she saw how the
fish enjoyed it. And the fish grew fat and big, but the girl grew thin
and weak. The loads of wood felt heavier every day. At last her
sisters noticed it.",133,fountain,is used for,decoration,What are fountains in gardens used for?,Decorating.

Hastening home the sister told the others what she had witnessed, and
that a lovely fat fish might be had for the catching. So the eldest
sister went and caught him. He was boiled for supper, but the
youngest sister was away in the woods, and did not know anything about
it.

Next morning she went as usual to the cave, and sang her little song,
but no Djulung came to answer it. Twice and thrice she sang. Then she threw
herself on her knees by the edge, and peered into the dark water, but
the trees cast such a deep shadow that her eyes could not pierce it.

'Djulung cannot be dead, or his body would be floating on the surface,'
she said to herself, and rising to her feet she set out homewards,
feeling all of a sudden strangely tired.

'What is the matter with me?' she thought, but somehow or other she
managed to reach the hut, and threw herself down in a corner, where she
slept so soundly that for days no one was able to wake her.",155,shadow,is the antonym of,light,What is the antonym of shadow?,Light.
the-bones-of-djulung,4,"At length, one morning early, a cock began to crow so loud that
she could sleep no longer and as he continued to crow she seemed to
understand what he was saying. He was telling her that Djulung
was dead, killed and eaten by her sisters. His bones lay buried
under the kitchen fire. Very softly she got up, and took up the large
stone under the fire. She was creeping out carried the bones to the cave
by the fountain, where she dug a hole and buried them anew. And as she
scooped out the hole with a stick she sang a song, bidding the bones
grow till they became a tree. A tree that reached up so high into the
heavens that its leaves would fall across the sea into another island,
whose king would pick them up.

As there was no Djulung to give her rice to, the girl soon became fat
again. As she was able to do her work as of old, her sisters did not
trouble about her. They never guessed that when she went into the forest
to gather her sticks. She never failed to pay a visit to the tree, which
grew taller and more wonderful day by day. Never was such a tree seen
before. Its trunk was of iron, its leaves were of silk, its flowers of
gold, and its fruit of diamonds. One evening, though the girl did
not know it, a soft breeze took one of the leaves, and blew it across
the sea to the feet of one of the king's attendants.",257,diamond,is at location of,jewelry_store,Where are diamonds usually sold?,In jewelry stores.

would never rest until he had found the tree which bore it, even if he
had to spend the rest of his life in visiting the islands that lay all
round. Happily for him, he began with the island that was nearest. 
Here in the forest he suddenly saw standing before him the iron tree.
Its boughs covered with shining leaves like the one he carried about
him.

'But what sort of a tree is it, and how did it get here?' he asked of
the attendants he had with him. No one could answer him. As they
were about to pass out of the forest a little boy went by, and the king
stopped and inquired if there was anyone living in the neighbourhood
whom he might question.

'Seven girls live in a hut down there,' replied the boy, pointing with
his finger to where the sun was setting.

'Then go and bring them here, and I will wait,' said the king. The
boy ran off and told the sisters that a great chief, with strings of
jewels round his neck, had sent for them.",232,string,is used for,tie,What are strings used for?,Tying things.

the youngest, who was busy, and who did not care about strangers, stayed
behind, to finish the work she was doing. The king welcomed the girls
eagerly, and asked them all manner of questions about the tree. As
they had never even heard of its existence, they could tell him nothing.
'And if we, who live close by the forest, do not know, you may be sure
no one does,' added the eldest, who was rather cross at finding this was
all that the king wanted of them.

'But the boy told me there were seven of you, and there are only six
here,' said the king.

'Oh, the youngest is at home, but she is always half asleep, and is of
no use except to cut wood for the fire,' replied they in a breath.

'That may be, but perhaps she dreams,' answered the king. 'Anyway, I
will speak to her also.' Then he signed to one of his attendants, who
followed the path that the boy had taken to the hut.

Soon the man returned, with the girl walking behind him. And as soon as
she reached the tree it bowed itself to the earth before her, and she
stretched out her hand and picked some of its leaves and flowers and
gave them to the king.

He obeyed her, and tried his best to kill one, but he came home unsuccessful. His sister told him that he must not despair, but try again the next day.",133,arrow,is capable of,hit_target,What can you do with an arrow?,I can hit target with an arrow.

Toward night-fall she heard his little footsteps crackling through the snow. He hurried in and threw down, with an air of triumph, one of the birds which he had killed. ""My sister,"" said he, ""I wish you to skin it, and stretch the skin, and when I have killed more, I will have a coat made out of them.""

""But what shall we do with the body?"" said she; for they had always up to that time lived upon greens and berries.

""Cut it in two,"" he answered, ""and season our pottage with one half of it at a time.""

It was their first dish of game, and they relished it greatly.

The boy kept on in his efforts, and in the course of time he killed ten birds-out of the skins of which his sister made him a little coat. Being very small, he had a very pretty coat, and a bird skin to spare.",30,hurry,causes,ride_bicycle,What do you do when you are in a hurry?,I ride bicycle when I am in a hurry.

Is there nobody else living? And, tell me, was all this great broad earth and this huge big sky made for a little boy and girl like you and me?""

She told him, by no means that there were many folks very unlike a harmless girl and boy, such as they were, who lived in a certain other quarter of the earth, who had killed off all of their kinsfolk. That if he would live blameless and not endanger his life, he must never go where they were. This only served to inflame the boy's curiosity. He soon after took his bow and arrows and went in that direction. After walking a long time and meeting no one, he became tired, and stretched himself upon a high green knoll where the day's warmth had melted off the snow.",186,direction,is a,message,What is direction?,Direction is a type of message that guides you.

When he felt how the sun had seared and the mischief its fiery beams had played with the coat he was so proud of, he flew into a great passion, and berated the sun in a terrible way for a little boy no higher than a man's knee. He vowed fearful things against it.

""Do not think you are too high,"" said he; ""I shall revenge myself. Oh, sun! I will have you for a plaything yet.""

On coming home he gave an account of his misfortune to his sister, and bitterly bewailed the spoiling of his new coat. He would not eat-not so much as a single berry. He lay down as one that fasts; nor did he move nor change his manner of lying for ten full days, though his sister strove to prevail on him to rise.

She said she had nothing. But after awhile she brought forward a deer's sinew which the father had left, and which she soon made into a string suitable for a noose. The moment she showed it to him he was quite angry, and told her that would not do, and directed her to find something else. She said she had nothing-nothing at all. At last she thought of the bird-skin that was left over when the coat was made; and this she wrought into a string. With this the little boy was more vexed than before. ""The sun has had enough of my bird-skins,"" he said; ""find something else."" She went out of the lodge saying to herself, ""Was there ever so obstinate a boy?"" She did not dare to answer this time that she had nothing. Luckily she thought of her own beautiful hair, and pulling some of it from among her locks, she quickly braided it into a cord. Upon returning, she handed it to her brother.",25,inform,causes,send_e_mail,What can you do when you want to inform somebody?,I can send e-mail to inform somebody.

He immediately began to run it back and forth through his hands as swiftly as he could. As he drew it forth, he tried its strength. He said again, ""this will do;"" and winding it in a glossy coil about his shoulders, he set out a little after midnight. His object was to catch the sun before he rose. He fixed his snare firmly on a spot just where the sun must strike the land as it rose above the earth. Sure enough, he caught the sun, so that it was held fast in the cord and did not rise.

The animals who ruled the earth were immediately put into great commotion. They had no light. They ran to and fro, calling out to each other, and inquiring what had happened. They summoned a council to debate upon the matter, and an old dormouse, suspecting where the trouble lay, proposed that some one should be appointed to go and cut the cord. This was a bold thing to undertake, as the rays of the sun could not fail to burn whoever should venture so near to them.",93,fix,is the antonym of,break,What can you do when you break something?,I can fix it.
the-boy-who-set-a-snare-for-the-sun,7,"At last the venerable dormouse himself undertook it, for the very good reason that no one else would. At this time the dormouse was the largest animal in the world. When he stood up he looked like a mountain. It made haste to the place where the sun lay ensnared, and as it came nearer and nearer, its back began to smoke and burn with the heat. The whole top of his huge bulk was turned in a very short time to enormous heaps of ashes. It succeeded, however, in cutting the cord with its teeth and freeing the sun, which rolled up again, as round and beautiful as ever, into the wide blue sky. But the dormouse-or blind woman as it is called-was shrunk away to a very small size. That is the reason why it is now one of the tiniest creatures upon the earth.

The little boy returned home when he discovered that the sun had escaped his snare, and devoted himself entirely to hunting. ""If the beautiful hair of my sister would not hold the sun fast, nothing in the world could,"" he said. ""He was not born, a little fellow like himself, to look after the sun. It required one greater and wiser than he was to regulate that."" And he went out and shot ten more snow-birds. In this business he was very expert, and he had a new bird-skin coat made, which was prettier than the one he had worn before.",41,mountain,is used for,climbing,What do you do when facing a mountain?,I climb the mountain.
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,1,"Dectera, one of the sisters of Conchubar Mac Nessa, married a prince
whose patrimony lay along the shores of the Muirnict, and whose capital
was Dun Dalgan. They had one child, a boy, whom they named Setanta.

As soon as Setanta was able to understand the stories and conversation
of those around him, he evinced a passion for arms and the martial life,
which was so premature and violent as to surprise all who knew him. His
thoughts for ever ran on the wars and achievements of the Red Branch. He
knew all the knights by name, the appearance and bearing of each, and
what deeds of valour they had severally performed. Emain Macha, the
capital of the Clanna Rury, was never out of his mind. He saw for ever
before his mind its moats and ramparts, its gates and bridges, its
streets filled with martial men, its high-raised Duns and Raths, its
branching roads, over which came the tributes of wide Ulla to the High
King. He had seen his father's tribute driven thither, and had even
longed to be one of the four-footed beasts that he beheld wending their
way to the wondrous city. But, above all, he delighted to be told of the
great school where the young nobles of Ulster were taught martial
exercises and the military art, under the superintendence of chosen
knights and of the High King himself. Of the several knights he had his
own opinion, and had already resolved to accept no one as his instructor
save Fergus Mac Roy, tanist of Ulster.",77,violent,is the antonym of,peaceful,What's the opposite of peaceful?,Violent.
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,2,"Of his father he saw little. His mind had become impaired, and he was
confined in a secluded part of the Dun. But whenever he spoke to Dectera
of what was nearest his heart, and his desire to enter the military
school at Emain Macha, she laughed, and said that he was not yet old
enough to endure that rough life. But secretly she was alarmed, and
formed plans to detain him at home altogether. Then Setanta concealed
his desire, but enquired narrowly concerning the partings of the roads
on the way to Emania.

At last, when he was ten years old, selecting a favourable night,
Setanta stole away from his father's Dun, and before morning had crossed
the frontier. He then lay down to rest and sleep in a wood. After this
he set out again, travelling quickly, lest he should be met by any of
his father's people. On his back was strapped his little wooden shield,
and by his side hung a sword of lath. He had brought his ball and hurle
of red-bronze with him, and ran swiftly along the road, driving the ball
before him, or throwing up his javelin into the air, and running to meet
it ere it fell.

the second wife. This second wife had not much regard for the son, and
he was obliged to go out on the mountain, far from the house, to take
care of the cattle.

There was a bracket (speckled) bull amongst the cows out on the
mountain, and of a day that there was great hunger on the lad, the
bracket bull heard him complaining and wringing his two hands. He
moved over to him and said to him, ""You are hungry, but take the horn
off me and lay it on the ground. Put your hand into the place where the
horn was and you will find food.""

twisted it, and it came away with him in his hand. He laid it on the
ground, put in his hand, and drew out food and drink and a table-cloth.

own daughter out after him, and told her to be watching him till she
should see where he was getting the food. The daughter went and put
herself in hiding, and she was watching him until the heat of the day
came. But when the middle of the day was come she heard every music more
excellent than another, and she was put to sleep by that truly melodious
music. The bull came then, and the lad twisted the horn off him and drew
out the table-cloth, the food, and the drink, and ate and drunk his

daughter woke up, and was watching him until the evening came, and he

not able to put the third eye to sleep. When the heat of the day came
she saw the bracket bull coming to the boy, and the boy taking the horn
off him and eating.

She ran home then, and said to her mother that there wasn't such a

the bracket bull.

Then the mother let on that she was sick, and she killed a cock, and she
let down its blood into her bed. She put up a sup of the blood into
her mouth, and she sent for her husband, saying that she was finding
death (dying). Her husband came in, and he saw the blood, and he said,

back in the evening, and he himself and the lad passed that night in the

strip of skin of the back and a strip of the stomach off me, and make a
belt of it, and at any time at all there will be any hard pinch on you,

bull killed him. The other bull went away then. The lad came to the
bracket bull where he was lying on the ground, and he was not dead,

The bracket bull spoke again, and told him to cut the strip off him on
the instant, and that it would assist him as long as he would be alive.
He cut a strip off the back then, and another strip off the belly, and
he went away.

There was plenty of trouble and of grief on him, going of him, and he
ought to have that on him too, and he departing without any knowledge of
where he was making for, or where he would go.

lad said that he did not himself know where he was going, but that he
was going looking for work.

land they will keep it, and I cannot take it off them again. That's all

the grass was getting scarce, he was driving the cows further out. There
was a big stone wall between the land of the giants and his master's
land. There was fine grass on the other side of the wall. When he saw
that, he threw down a gap in the wall and let in the pigs and the cows.
He went up into a tree then, and was throwing down apples and all sorts
(of fruit) to the pigs.

A giant came out, and when he saw the lad up on the tree throwing down
the apples to the pigs, the head rose on him (i.e., he got furious). He
came to the tree. ""Get down out of that,"" says he. ""I think you big for
one bite and small for two bites; come down till I draw you under my
long cold teeth.""

""Arrah, take yourself easy,"" says the boy; ""perhaps it's too quick I'd
come down to you.""

""I won't be talking to you any longer,"" says the giant. He got a
leverage on the tree and drew it up out of the roots.

""Go down, black thong, and squeeze that fellow,"" says the lad, for he
remembered the advice of the bracket bull. On the instant the black
thong leaped out of his hand, and squeezed the giant so hard that the
two eyes were going out on his head, for stronger was the power of the
bull than the power of the giant. The giant was not able to put a stir
out of himself, and he promised anything at all--only to save his life

it from me.""",246,thong,is a,leather_strip,What is a thong?,A thong is a leather strip.

feel it in your hand going through them,"" says the giant.

he did not come home yet.""

On the next day the lad drove out his cattle until he came to the big
stone wall, and he threw a gap in it, and let the cattle into the same
place. He went up into a tree and began throwing down the apples. The
second giant came running, and said, ""What's the meaning of throwing my
wall and letting in your cattle on my estate? Get down out of that at
once. You killed my brother yesterday.""

""Go down, black thong, and bind that one,"" says the lad. The thong
squeezed him so that he was not able to put a stir out of himself, and
he promised the lad anything at all--only to spare his life.

there was another change in the caher that day again, as he did not hear
but only one shout, but the lad said that he saw another one going away
that day, and that it was likely that he did not come back yet.

hall door, and was throwing down the apples to them. The third giant
came out--the eldest man of them--and he was full mad after his two
brothers being dead, and the teeth that were in his head were making a
hand-stick for him. He told the boy to come down; that he did not know
what he would do to him after his having killed his two brothers. ""Come
down,"" says he, ""till I draw you under my long, cold teeth""; and it was

the-brown-bear-of-norway,3,"Well, when the princess woke in the morning, she missed her husband from
her side, and spent the day very sadly. But as soon as the lamps were
lighted in the grand hall, where she was sitting on a sofa covered with
silk, the folding doors flew open, and he was sitting by her side the
next minute. So they spent another happy evening, but he warned her that
whenever she began to tire of him, or ceased to have faith in him,
they would be parted for ever, and he'd be obliged to marry the witch's
daughter.

She got used to find him absent by day, and they spent a happy
twelvemonth together, and at last a beautiful little boy was born; and
happy as she was before, she was twice as happy now, for she had her
child to keep her company in the day when she couldn't see her husband.

At last, one evening, when herself, and himself, and her child were
sitting with a window open because it was a sultry night, in flew an
eagle, took the infant's sash in his beak, and flew up in the air with
him. She screamed, and was going to throw herself out the window after
him, but the prince caught her, and looked at her very seriously. She
bethought of what he said soon after their marriage, and she stopped the
cries and complaints that were on her tongue. She spent her days very
lonely for another twelvemonth, when a beautiful little girl was sent to
her. Then she thought to herself she'd have a sharp eye about her this
time; so she never would allow a window to be more than a few inches
open.",251,seriously,has context of,manner,What is seriously?,In a serious or literal manner.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,4,"But all her care was in vain. Another evening, when they were all so
happy, and the prince dandling the baby, a beautiful greyhound stood
before them, took the child out of the father's hand, and was out of
the door before you could wink. This time she shouted and ran out of
the room, but there were some of the servants in the next room, and all
declared that neither child nor dog passed out. She felt, somehow, as if
it was her husband's fault, but still she kept command over herself, and
didn't once reproach him.

When the third child was born she would hardly allow a window or a door
to be left open for a moment; but she wasn't the nearer to keep the
child to herself. They were sitting one evening by the fire, when a
lady appeared standing by them. The princess opened her eyes in a great
fright and stared at her, and while she was doing so, the lady wrapped
a shawl round the baby that was sitting in its father's lap, and either
sank through the ground with it or went up through the wide chimney.
This time the mother kept her bed for a month.",113,reproach,is a,dissatisfaction,Why shouldn't we often reproach others?,Because it brings dissatisfaction to others.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,5,"'My dear,' said she to her husband, when she was beginning to recover,
'I think I'd feel better if I was to see my father and mother and
sisters once more. If you give me leave to go home for a few days I'd
be glad.' 'Very well,' said he, 'I will do that, and whenever you feel
inclined to return, only mention your wish when you lie down at night.'
The next morning when she awoke she found herself in her own old chamber
in her father's palace. She rang the bell, and in a short time she had
her mother and father and married sisters about her, and they laughed
till they cried for joy at finding her safe back again.",77,mention,has subevent,notice,What is mention?,To make something noticed.

what to advise her to do. She was as fond of her husband as ever, and
said she was sure that he couldn't help letting the children go; but
still she was afraid beyond the world to have another child torn from
her. Well, the mother and sisters consulted a wise woman that used to
bring eggs to the castle, for they had great faith in her wisdom. She
said the only plan was to secure the bear's skin that the prince was
obliged to put on every morning, and get it burned, and then he couldn't
help being a man night and day, and the enchantment would be at an end.

So they all persuaded her to do that, and she promised she would; and
after eight days she felt so great a longing to see her husband again
that she made the wish the same night, and when she woke three hours
after, she was in her husband's palace, and he himself was watching over
her. There was great joy on both sides, and they were happy for many
days.",100,secure,has subevent,guarantee,What is secure?,To guarantee that something is safe.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,7,"Now she began to think how she never minded her husband leaving her in
the morning, and how she never found him neglecting to give her a sweet
drink out of a gold cup just as she was going to bed.

One night she contrived not to drink any of it, though she pretended to
do so; and she was wakeful enough in the morning, and saw her husband
passing out through a panel in the wainscot, though she kept her eyelids
nearly closed. The next night she got a few drops of the sleepy posset
that she saved the evening before put into her husband's night drink,
and that made him sleep sound enough. She got up after midnight, passed
through the panel, and found a Beautiful brown bear's hide hanging in
the corner. Then she stole back, and went down to the parlour fire, and
put the hide into the middle of it till it was all fine ashes. She then
lay down by her husband, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and fell asleep.

If she was to live a hundred years she'd never forget how she wakened
next morning, and found her husband looking down on her with misery and
anger in his face. 'Unhappy woman,' said he, 'you have separated us for
ever! Why hadn't you patience for five years? I am now obliged, whether
I like or no, to go a three days' journey to the witch's castle, and
marry her daughter. The skin that was my guard you have burned it, and
the egg-wife that gave you the counsel was the witch herself. I won't
reproach you: your punishment will be severe without it. Farewell for
ever!'",23,neglect,is the antonym of,notice,What is neglect?,Failure to notice something.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,8,"He kissed her for the last time, and was off the next minute, walking
as fast as he could. She shouted after him, and then seeing there was no
use, she dressed herself and pursued him. He never stopped, nor stayed,
nor looked back, and still she kept him in sight; and when he was on the
hill she was in the hollow, and when he was in the hollow she was on
the hill. Her life was almost leaving her, when, just as the sun was
setting, he turned up a lane, and went into a little house. She crawled
up after him, and when she got inside there was a beautiful little boy
on his knees, and he kissing and hugging him.",141,hug,is used for,help_who_feeling_bad,How can we help those feeling bad?,We can hug them to encourage them.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,9,"'Here, my poor darling,'says he, 'is your eldest child, and there,' says he, pointing to a woman
that was looking on with a smile on her face, 'is the eagle that carried
him away.' She forgot all her sorrows in a moment, hugging her child,
and laughing and crying over him. The woman washed their feet, and
rubbed them with an ointment that took all the soreness out of their
bones, and made them as fresh as a daisy. Next morning, just before
sunrise, he was up, and prepared to be off, 'Here,' said he to her, 'is
a thing which may be of use to you. It's a scissors, and whatever stuff
you cut with it will be turned into silk. The moment the sun rises, I'll
lose all memory of yourself and the children, but I'll get it at sunset
again. Farewell!' But he wasn't far gone till she was in sight of him
again, leaving her boy behind. It was the same to-day as yesterday:
their shadows went before them in the morning and followed them in the
evening. He never stopped, and she never stopped, and as the sun was
setting he turned up another lane, and there they found their little
daughter. It was all joy and comfort again till morning, and then the
third day's journey commenced.",164,child,is at location of,school,Where should a child be educated?,School.

used it, pearls and diamonds would fall from her hair. Still he had his
memory from sunset to sunrise; but from sunrise to sunset he travelled
on under the charm, and never threw his eye behind. This night they
came to where the youngest baby was, and the next morning, just before
sunrise, the prince spoke to her for the last time. 'Here, my poor
wife,' said he, 'is a little hand-reel, with gold thread that has no
end, and the half of our marriage ring. If you ever get to my house,
and put your half-ring to mine, I shall recollect you. There is a wood
yonder, and the moment I enter it I shall forget everything that ever
happened between us, just as if I was born yesterday. Farewell, dear
wife and child, for ever!' Just then the sun rose, and away he walked
towards the wood. She saw it open before him and close after him, and
when she came up, she could no more get in than she could break
through a stone wall. She wrung her hands and shed tears, but then she
recollected herself, and cried out, 'Wood, I charge you by my three
magic gifts, the scissors, the comb, and the reel--to let me through';
and it opened, and she went along a walk till she came in sight of a
palace, and a lawn, and a woodman's cottage on the edge of the wood
where it came nearest the palace.",48,charm,is a,object,What is a charm?,Something believed to have magic power.

into their service. They were not willing at first; but she told them
she would ask no wages, and would give them diamonds, and pearls, and
silk stuffs, and gold thread whenever they wished for them, and then
they agreed to let her stay.

It wasn't long till she heard how a young prince, that was just arrived,
was living in the palace of the young mistress. He seldom stirred
abroad, and every one that saw him remarked how silent and sorrowful he
went about, like a person that was searching for some lost thing.",41,diamond,is a,hardest_substance_on_earth,What is the hardest substance on the earth?,Diamond.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,12,"The servants and conceited folk at the big house began to take notice
of the beautiful young woman at the lodge, and to annoy her with their
impudence. The head footman was the most troublesome, and at last she
invited him to come and take tea with her. Oh, how rejoiced he was, and
how he bragged of it in the servants' hall! Well, the evening came, and
the footman walked into the lodge, and was shown to her sitting-room;
for the lodge-keeper and his wife stood in great awe of her, and gave
her two nice rooms for herself. Well, he sat down as stiff as a ramrod,
and was talking in a grand style about the great doings at the castle,
while she was getting the tea and toast ready. 'Oh,' says she to him,
'would you put your hand out at the window and cut me off a sprig or two
of honeysuckle?' He got up in great glee, and put out his hand and head;
and said she, 'By the virtue of my magic gifts, let a pair of horns
spring out of your head, and sing to the lodge.' Just as she wished, so
it was. They sprung from the front of each ear, and met at the back. Oh,
the poor wretch! And how he bawled and roared! and the servants that he
used to be boasting to were soon flocking from the castle, and grinning,
and huzzaing, and beating tunes on tongs and shovels and pans; and he
cursing and swearing, and the eyes ready to start out of his head, and
he so black in the face, and kicking out his legs behind him like mad.",259,roar,has subevent,make_noise,What is roar?,To make a loud noice.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,13,"At last she pitied him, and removed the charm, and the horns dropped
down on the ground, and he would have killed her on the spot, only he
was as weak as water, and his fellow-servants came in and carried him up
to the big house. Well, some way or other the story came to the ears of
the prince, and he strolled down that way. She had only the dress of a
countrywoman on her as she sat sewing at the window, but that did not
hide her beauty, and he was greatly puzzled after he had a good look,
just as a body is puzzled to know whether something happened to him when
he was young or if he only dreamed it. Well, the witch's daughter heard
about it too, and she came to see the strange girl; and what did she
find her doing but cutting out the pattern of a gown from brown paper;
and as she cut away, the paper became the richest silk she ever saw. The
witch's daughter looked on with greedy eyes, and, says she, 'What would
you be satisfied to take for that scissors?' 'I'll take nothing,' says
she, 'but leave to spend one night outside the prince's chamber.' Well,
the proud lady fired up, and was going to say something dreadful; but
the scissors kept on cutting, and the silk growing richer and richer
every inch. So she promised what the girl had asked her.",173,brown,is a,color,What is brown?,A color like that of chocolate or coffee.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,14,"When night came on she was let into the palace and lay down till the
prince was in such a dead sleep that all she did couldn't awake him.
She sung this verse to him, sighing and sobbing, and kept singing it the
night long, and it was all in vain:

Four long years I was married to thee; Three sweet babes I bore to thee;
Brown Bear of Norway, turn to me.

At the first dawn the proud lady was in the chamber, and led her away,
and the footman of the horns put out his tongue at her as she was
quitting the palace.

So there was no luck so far; but the next day the prince passed by again
and looked at her, and saluted her kindly, as a prince might a farmer's
daughter, and passed one; and soon the witch's daughter passed by, and
found her combing her hair, and pearls and diamonds dropping from it.

Well, another bargain was made, and the princess spent another night of
sorrow, and she left the castle at daybreak, and the footman was at his
post and enjoyed his revenge.",142,salute,is a,greeting,What is salute?,A gesture expressing greeting to someone.
the-brown-bear-of-norway,15,"The third day the prince went by, and stopped to talk with the strange
woman. He asked her could he do anything to serve her, and she said he
might. She asked him did he ever wake at night. He said that he often
did, but that during the last two nights he was listening to a sweet
song in his dreams, and could not wake, and that the voice was one that
he must have known and loved in some other world long ago. Says she,
'Did you drink any sleepy posset either of these evenings before you
went to bed?' 'I did,' said he. 'The two evenings my wife gave me
something to drink, but I don't know whether it was a sleepy posset or
not.' 'Well, prince,' said she, 'as you say you would wish to oblige me,
you can do it by not tasting any drink to-night.' 'I will not,' says he,
and then he went on his walk.

Well, the great lady came soon after the prince, and found the stranger
using her hand-reel and winding threads of gold off it, and the third
bargain was made.

That evening the prince was lying on his bed at twilight, and his mind
much disturbed; and the door opened, and in his princess walked, and
down she sat by his bedside and sung:

Four long years I was married to thee; Three sweet babes I bore to thee;
Brown Bear of Norway, turn to me.",215,thread,is used for,sewing,"What is the long, thin and flexible form of material used in sewing?",Thread.

not,' said he, 'but I'm sure I wish it was so.' 'Don't you remember our
three babes that are still alive?' 'Show me them. My mind is all a heap
of confusion.' 'Look for the half of our marriage ring, that hangs at
your neck, and fit it to this.' He did so, and the same moment the charm
was broken. His full memory came back on him, and he flung his arms
round his wife's neck, and both burst into tears.

Well, there was a great cry outside, and the castle walls were heard
splitting and cracking. Everyone in the castle was alarmed, and made
their way out. The prince and princess went with the rest, and by the
time all were safe on the lawn, down came the building, and made the
ground tremble for miles round. No one ever saw the witch and her
daughter afterwards. It was not long till the prince and princess had
their children with them, and then they set out for their own palace.

You might have walked a whole day without meeting anyone happier or more

daughter called Barbaik, the most graceful dancer and the best-dressed
girl in the whole country side. When she appeared on holidays in her
embroidered cap, five petticoats, each one a little shorter than the
other, and shoes with silver buckles, the women were all filled with
envy, but little cared Barbaik what they might whisper behind her back

'It is I, the brownie of the lake,' replied the voice.

'But where are you?' inquired Jegu.'Look close, and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little
green frog. I can take,' he added proudly, 'any shape I choose, and
even, which is much harder, be invisible if I want to.'

'Then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally
appear,' replied Jegu.

have no fears, for he would not do him any harm; indeed, he hoped that
Jegu might find him of some use.

'But why should you take all this interest in me?' asked the peasant
suspiciously.

'Because of a service you did me last winter, which I have never
forgotten,' answered the little fellow. 'You know, I am sure, that
the korigans who dwell in the White Corn
country have declared war on my people, because they say that they are
the friends of man. We were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant
lands, and to hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes.

'Yes,' answered Jegu, 'I remember it very well, and I opened the net and
let him go.'

'Well, I was that robin redbreast, and ever since I have vowed to be
your friend, and as you want to marry Barbaik, I will prove the truth of
what I say by helping you to do so.'

'Ah! my little brownie, if you can do that, there is nothing I won't
give you, except my soul.'

'Then let me alone,' rejoined the dwarf, 'and I promise you that in a
very few months you shall be master of the farm and of Barbaik.'

'But how are you going to do it?' exclaimed Jegu wonderingly.

Next morning was a holiday, and Barbaik was awake earlier than usual, as
she wished to get through her work as soon as possible, and be ready to
start for a dance which was to be held some distance off. She went
first to the cow-house, which it was her duty to keep clean, but to her

she stopped and thanked him for his help. To be sure, Jegu only replied
roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about, but this answer
made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else.

The same thing took place every day, and never had the cow-house been so
clean nor the cows so fat. Morning and evening Barbaik found her earthen
pots full of milk and a pound of butter freshly churned, ornamented
with leaves. At the end of a few weeks she grew so used to this state of

fields to come and eat it. This, also, she thought was the work of Jegu,

If she was too lazy to walk all the way to market along a dirty road,
she would say out loud the night before, 'Why am I not already back from
Morlaix with my milk pot empty, my butter bowl inside it, a pound of
wild cherries on my wooden plate, and the money I have gained in my
apron pocket?' and in the morning when she got up, lo and behold! there
were standing at the foot of her bed the empty milk pot with the butter
bowl inside, the black cherries on the wooden plate, and six new pieces
of silver in the pocket of her apron. And she believed that all this

he had better ask Barbaik to marry him, and this time the girl did not
turn rudely away, but listened patiently to the end. In her eyes he was
as ugly and awkward as ever, but he would certainly make a most useful
husband, and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time, just
like a young lady, and as for the rest of the day, it would not be
half long enough for all she meant to do. She would wear the beautiful
dresses that came when she wished for them, and visit her neighbours,
who would be dying of envy all the while, and she would be able to dance
as much as she wished. Jegu would always be there to work for her and
save for her, and watch over her. So, like a well-brought-up girl,

once more the brownie stepped in, and was better than ten labourers.
It was he who ploughed and sowed and reaped, and if, as happened,
occasionally, it was needful to get the work done quickly, the brownie
called in some of his friends, and as soon as it was light a host of

the very day of her marriage Barbaik had noted with surprise and rage
that things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the
weeks and months before. She complained to Jegu of his laziness, and he
only stared at her, not understanding what she was talking about. But
the brownie, who was standing by, burst out laughing, and confessed that
all the good offices she spoke of had been performed by him, for the
sake of Jegu, but that now he had other business to do, and it was high

sit up till midnight in order to churn the butter, her heart was filled
with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of
ease and pleasure. But when she looked at Jegu and beheld his red face,

would have brought me present of nuts and cherries, and told me that
I was the prettiest girl in the parish. While now I can receive no

put her pride in her pocket when it suited her, and after receiving an
invitation to a wedding, she begged the brownie to get her a horse to
ride there. To her great joy he consented, bidding her set out for the
city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted. Full of
excitement, Barbaik started on her journey. It was not long, and when
she reached the town she went straight to the dwarfs, who were holding

she started for the village where the wedding was to be held.

At first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work
which she hated, that she noticed nothing, but very soon it struck
her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all
laughed as they looked at her horse. At length she caught some words
uttered by one man to another. 'Why, the farmer's wife has sold her
horse's tail!' and turned in her saddle. Yes; it was true. Her horse

there. Of course, Jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything
for the brownie, and he ordered Barbaik to spread her best table-cloths
in the barn, and to make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes,
and, besides, to keep all the milk given by the cows that morning. He

placed pans of hot coals under their feet, and all their poor little
toes were burnt.'You won't forget that in a hurry,' she said, smiling grimly to herself,
but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water, which
they poured on the fire. Then they joined hands and danced round it,

ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest, or was
cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang, which always
returns to the thrower. They did not get on very fast at this rate, but

all ceased to be afraid, when they were startled by a low rushing sound
behind them, and, looking round, saw that the pool was slowly rising,

yet. Safe! why only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of
water, and these were fast disappearing. They must run fast indeed if
they were to escape. So on they flew, scarcely feeling the ground as
they went, till they flung themselves on the ground before the holes
scooped out of the earth where they had all been born. The old men were
sitting in front, the children were playing, and the women chattering
together, when the little Bunyip fell into their midst, and there was

the-celestial-sisters,1,"Waupee, or the White Hawk, lived in a remote part of the forest, where animals abounded. Every day he returned from the chase with a large spoil, for he was one of the most skillful and lucky hunters of his tribe. His form was like the cedar. The fire of youth beamed from his eye. There was no forest too gloomy for him to penetrate, and no track made by bird or beast of any kind which he could not readily follow.

One day he had gone beyond any point which he had ever before visited. He traveled through an open wood, which enabled him to see a great distance. At length he beheld a light breaking through the foliage of the distant trees, which made him sure that he was on the borders of a prairie. It was a wide plain, covered with long blue grass, and enameled with flowers of a thousand lovely tints.",147,border,is capable of,divide_two_countries,What is the line or frontier area which can divide two countries?,The border.
the-celestial-sisters,2,"After walking for some time without a path, musing upon the open country, and enjoying the fragrant breeze, he suddenly came to a ring worn among the grass and the flowers. It was as if it had been made by footsteps moving lightly round and round. But it was strange-so strange as to cause the White Hawk to pause and gaze long and fixedly upon the ground. There was no path which led to this flowery circle. There was not even a crushed leaf nor a broken twig, nor the least trace of a footstep, approaching or retiring, to be found. He thought he would hide himself and lie in wait to discover, if he could, what this strange circle meant.

Presently he heard the faint sounds of music in the air. He looked up in the direction they came from, and as the magic notes died away he saw a small object, like a little summer cloud that approaches the earth, floating down from above. At first it was very small, and seemed as if it could have been blown away by the first breeze that came along. But it rapidly grew as he gazed upon it, and the music every moment came clearer and more sweetly to his ear. As it neared the earth it appeared as a basket, and it was filled with twelve sisters, of the most lovely forms and enchanting beauty.

As soon as the basket touched the ground they leaped out. They began straightway to dance, in the most joyous manner, around the magic ring, striking, as they did so, a shining ball, which uttered the most ravishing melodies, and kept time as they danced.",307,melody,is a,musical_perception,How to establish the musical perception?,By being exposed to melodies.
the-celestial-sisters,3,"The White Hawk, from his concealment, entranced, gazed upon their graceful forms and movements. He admired them all, but he was most pleased with the youngest. He longed to be at her side, to embrace her, to call her his own. Unable to remain longer a silent admirer, he rushed out and endeavored to seize this twelfth beauty who so enchanted him. But the sisters, with the quickness of birds, the moment they descried the form of a man, leaped back into the basket, and were drawn up into the sky.

Lamenting his ill-luck, Waupee gazed longingly upon the fairy basket as it ascended and bore the lovely sisters from his view. ""They are gone,"" he said, ""and I shall see them no more.""

He returned to his solitary lodge, but he found no relief to his mind. He walked abroad, but to look at the sky, which had withdrawn from his sight the only being he had ever loved, was painful to him now.",70,enchant,has subevent,please,What is enchant?,To attract and please.
the-celestial-sisters,4,"The next day, selecting the same hour, the White Hawk went back to the prairie, and took his station near the ring. In order to deceive the sisters, he assumed the form of an opossum, and sat among the grass as if he were there engaged in chewing the cud. He had not waited long when he saw the cloudy basket descend, and heard the same sweet music falling as before. He crept slowly toward the ring. But the instant the sisters caught sight of him they were startled, and sprang into their car. It rose a short distance when one of the elder sisters spoke:

""Perhaps,"" she said, ""it is come to show us how the game is played by mortals.""

""Oh no,"" the youngest replied; ""quick, let us ascend.""

And all joining in a chant, they rose out of sight.

Waupee, casting off his disguise, walked sorrowfully back to his lodge-but ah, the night seemed very long to lonely White Hawk! His whole soul was filled with the thought of the beautiful sister.",93,sight,has subevent,perceive,How to perceive the world?,With sight.
the-celestial-sisters,5,"Betimes, the next day, he returned to the haunted spot, hoping and fearing, and sighing as though his very soul would leave his body in its anguish. He reflected upon the plan he should follow to secure success. He had already failed twice. To fail a third time would be fatal. Near by he found an old stump, much covered with moss. It was just then in use as the residence of a number of mice, who had stopped there on a pilgrimage to some relatives on the other side of the prairie. The White Hawk was so pleased with their tidy little forms that he thought he, too, would be a mouse, especially as they were by no means formidable to look at, and would not be at all likely to create alarm.

He accordingly, having first brought the stump and set it near the ring, without further notice became a mouse. He peeped and sported about, and kept his sharp little eyes busy with the others. But he did not forget to keep one eye up toward the sky, and one ear wide open in the same direction.",96,relative,is a,person_who,What is a relative?,The person who is connected to someone else.
the-celestial-sisters,6,"It was not long before the sisters, at their customary hour, came down and resumed their sport.

""But see,"" cried the younger sister, ""that stump was not there before.""

She ran off, frightened, toward the basket. Her sisters only smiled, and gathering round the old tree-stump, they struck it, in jest, when out ran the mice, and among them Waupee. They killed them all but one, which was pursued by the younger sister. Just as she had raised a silver stick which she held in her hand to put an end to it, too, the form of the White Hawk arose, and he clasped his prize in his arms. The other eleven sprang to their basket, and were drawn up to the skies.

Waupee exerted all his skill to please his bride and win her affections. He wiped the tears from her eyes. He related his adventures in the chase. He dwelt upon the charms of life on the earth. He was constant in his attentions, keeping fondly by her side, and picking out the way for her to walk as he led her gently toward his lodge. He felt his heart glow with joy as he entered it, and from that moment he was one of the happiest of men.",189,earth,is part of,universe,Which planet in the universe do humans live?,The Earth.
the-celestial-sisters,7,"Winter and summer passed rapidly away. As the spring drew near with its balmy gales and its many-colored flowers, their happiness was increased by the presence of a beautiful boy in their lodge. What more of earthly blessing was there for them to enjoy?

Waupee's wife was a daughter of one of the stars. As the scenes of earth began to pall upon her sight, she sighed to revisit her father. But she was obliged to hide these feelings from her husband. She remembered the charm that would carry her up, and while White Hawk was engaged in the chase, she took occasion to construct a wicker basket, which she kept concealed. In the mean time, she collected such rarities from the earth as she thought would please her father, as well as the most dainty kinds of food.",133,rarity,is a,scarcity,What is rarity?,A measure of the scarcity of an object.
the-celestial-sisters,8,"One day when Waupee was absent, and all was in readiness, she went out to the charmed ring, taking with her her little son. As they entered the car she commenced her magical song, and the basket rose. The song was sad, and of a lowly and mournful cadence. As it was wafted far away by the wind, it caught her husband's ear. It was a voice which he well knew, and he instantly ran to the prairie. Though he made breathless speed, he could not reach the ring before his wife and child had ascended beyond his reach. He lifted up his voice in loud appeals, but they were unavailing. The basket still went up. He watched it till it became a small speck, and finally it vanished in the sky. He then bent his head down to the ground, and was miserable.

Through a long winter and a long summer Waupee bewailed his loss, but he found no relief. The beautiful spirit had come and gone, and he should see it no more!

He mourned his wife's loss sorely, but his son's still more. The boy had both the mother's beauty and the father's strength.

In the mean time his wife had reached her home in the stars. In the blissful employments of her father's house she had almost forgotten that she had left a husband upon the earth. But her son, as he grew up, resembled more and more his father. Every day he was restless and anxious to visit the scene of his birth. His grandfather said to his daughter, one day:",109,ascend,is the antonym of,descend,What is the opposite of ascend?,Descend.
the-celestial-sisters,9,"""Go, my child, and take your son down to his father, and ask him to come up and live with us. But tell him to bring along a specimen of each kind of bird and animal he kills in the chase.""

She accordingly took the boy and descended. The White Hawk, who was ever near the enchanted spot, heard her voice as she came down the sky. His heart beat with impatience as he saw her form and that of his son, and they were soon clasped in his arms.

He heard the message of the Star, and he began to hunt with the greatest activity, that he might collect the present with all dispatch. He spent whole nights, as well as days, in searching for every curious and beautiful animal and bird. He only preserved a foot, a wing, or a tail of each.

When all was ready, Waupee visited once more each favorite spot. The hill-top where he had been used to see the rising sun. The stream where he had sported as a boy. The old lodge, now looking sad and solemn, which he was to sit in no more. Last of all, coming to the magic circle, he gazed widely around him with tearful eyes. Taking his wife and child by the hand, they entered the car and were drawn up-into a country far beyond the flight of birds, or the power of mortal eye to pierce.",33,specimen,is a,sample,What is the specimen?,An individual sample that represents a class.
the-celestial-sisters,10,"Great joy was manifested upon their arrival at the starry plains. The Star Chief invited all his people to a feast. When they had assembled, he proclaimed aloud that each one might continue as he was, an inhabitant of his own dominions, or select of the earthly gifts such as he liked best. A very strange confusion immediately arose. Not one but sprang forward. Some chose a foot, some a wing, some a tail, and some a claw. Those who selected tails or claws were changed into animals, and ran off. The others assumed the form of birds, and flew away. Waupee chose a white hawk's feather. His wife and son followed his example, and each one became a white hawk. He spread his wings, and, followed by his wife and son, descended with the other birds to the earth, where he is still to be found, with the brightness of the starry plains in his eye, and the freedom of the heavenly breezes in his wings.",1,joy,is a,pleasant_emotion,What is the pleasant emotion?,Joy.

hosts encompass Tara on all sides, keeping watch and ward when the fatal
night comes. Then the son of Midna plays on his Druidic instrument of
music, on his magic pipe and his magic lyre, and as the fairy music
falls on our ears, our eyelids grow heavy, and soon all subside upon the
grass in deep slumber. So comes this man against the city and shoots his
fire-balls against it, and utterly consumes it. Nine years he has burnt
Tara in that manner, and this is the tenth. At midnight to-night he will
come and do the same. Last year (though it was a shame to me that I, who
am the high King over all Ireland, should not be able myself to defend
Tara) I summoned Gaul mac Morna and all the Fians to my assistance. They
came, but the pipe and lyre of the son of Midna prevailed over them too,

He begged her to bear in mind that she should respect his old age, if there was any sense of virtue left in her.

father had become a Taoist in his later years and had vanished in the
clouds without ever returning. The mother lived in poverty with the
daughter; yet since the girl was beautiful beyond measure she was
seeking a distinguished husband for her.

ill of longing, and was near death. My parents wanted to send for you,

that I married you disguised as a human maiden. I had not ventured to

him. The man was Liu I. He beckoned to his cousin, and the latter drew
up his garments and stepped into the boat with him. But when he had

remaining pearls are in part sea-crane pearls, in part snail and

carries, neither wind nor rain, thunder nor lightning, water, fire nor

glow by night. Within the circle of their light the poison of serpents
and worms is powerless. The serpent-pearls are seven-colored, the
mussel-pearls five-colored. Both shine by night. Those most free from
spots are the best. They grow within the mussel, and increase and

took up a sea-crane pearl in his bill and began to dance and sing and
flutter around. But the serpent snatched at the serpent-pearl, and
wound himself about it in many coils. And when the people saw this
they acknowledged the truth of the wise man's words. As regards the

preserved in the treasury. Then he bestowed high rank and titles on
the three brothers, and made each one of them a present of a thousand
rolls of fine silk stuff. He also had investigated why it was that the

the-elfin-knight,1,"There is a lone moor in Scotland, which, in times past, was said to be
haunted by an Elfin Knight. This Knight was only seen at rare intervals,
once in every seven years or so, but the fear of him lay on all the
country round, for every now and then someone would set out to cross the
moor and would never be heard of again.

And although men might search every inch of the ground, no trace of him
would be found, and with a thrill of horror the searching party would go
home again, shaking their heads and whispering to one another that he
had fallen into the hands of the dreaded Knight.

So, as a rule, the moor was deserted, for nobody dare pass that way,
much less live there; and by and by it became the haunt of all sorts of
wild animals, which made their lairs there, as they found that they
never were disturbed by mortal huntsmen.

Now in that same region lived two young earls, Earl St. Clair and Earl
Gregory, who were such friends that they rode, and hunted, and fought
together, if need be.",136,desert,is a,dry_environment,What's desert?,Dry environment.

day that they should go a-hunting on the haunted moor, in spite of the
Elfin King.

""Certes, I hardly believe in him at all,"" cried the young man, with a
laugh. ""Methinks it is but an old wife's tale to frighten the bairns
withal, lest they go straying amongst the heather and lose themselves.
And it is pity that such fine sport should be lost because we--two
bearded men--pay heed to such gossip.""

But Earl St. Clair looked grave. ""It is ill meddling with unchancy
things,"" he answered, ""and it is no bairn's tale that travellers have set
out to cross that moor who have vanished bodily, and never mair been
heard of; but it is, as thou sayest, a pity that so much good sport be
lost, all because an Elfin Knight choosest to claim the land as his, and

that I am one of the bairns,"" he said, ""first to be frightened by an
idle tale, and then to think that a leaf of clover will protect me? No,
no, carry that Sign if thou wilt; I will trust to my good bow and
arrow.""

But Earl St. Clair did not heed his companion's words, for he remembered
how his mother had told him, when he was a little lad at her knee that
whoso carried the Sign of the Blessed Trinity need never fear any spell
that might be thrown over him by Warlock or Witch, Elf or Demon.

So he went out to the meadow and plucked a leaf of clover, which he
bound on his arm with a silken scarf; then he mounted his horse and rode
with Earl Gregory to the desolate and lonely moorland.",183,meadow,is at location of,countryside,Where's meadow?,At the location of countryside.
the-elfin-knight,4,"For some hours all went well; and in the heat of the chase the young men
forgot their fears. Then suddenly both of them reined in their steeds
and sat gazing in front of them with affrighted faces.

For a horseman had crossed their track, and they both would fain have
known who he was and whence he came.

""By my troth, but he rideth in haste, whoever he may be,"" said Earl
Gregory at last, ""and though I always thought that no steed on earth could
match mine for swiftness, I reckon that for every league that mine
goeth, his would go seven. Let us follow him, and see from what part of
the world he cometh.""

""The Lord forbid that thou shouldst stir thy horse's feet to follow
him,"" said Earl St. Clair devoutly. ""Why, man, it is the Elfin Knight!
Canst thou not see that he doth not ride on the solid ground, but flieth
through the air, and that, although he rideth on what seemeth a mortal
steed, he is really craried by mighty pinions, which cleave the air like
those of a bird? Follow him forsooth! It will be an evil day for thee

Gregory said sharply, ""Thy mind hath gone mad over this Elfin King. I
tell thee he who passed was a goodly Knight, clad in a green vesture,
and riding on a great black jennet. And because I love a gallant
horseman, and would fain learn his name and degree, I will follow him
till I find him, even if it be at the world's end.""

And without another word he put spurs to his horse and galloped off in
the direction which the mysterious stranger had taken, leaving Earl St.
Clair alone upon the moorland, his fingers touching the sacred Sign and
his trembling lips muttering prayers for protection.

For he knew that his friend had been bewitched, and he made up his mind,
brave gentleman that he was, that he would follow him to the world's
end, if need be, and try to deliver him from the spell that had been
cast over him.",161,mutter,is a,sound,What's mutter?,Sound.

Earl was so powerful that, in spite of his fear, he felt that he must
obey the eldrich summons, and he threw his bridle on his horse's neck
and prepared to join them.

But just then an old and grizzled Goblin stepped out from among his
companions and approached him.

Apparently he dare not leave the charmed Circle, for he stopped at the
edge of it; then, stooping down and pretending to pick up something, he
whispered in a hoarse whisper:

""I know not whom thou art, nor from whence thou comest, Sir Knight, but

amongst the ghostly dancers.

At his coming they shouted louder than ever, and danced more madly, and
sang more lustily; then, all at once, a silence fell upon them, and they
parted into two companies, leaving a way through their midst, up which
they signed to the Earl to pass.

He walked through their ranks till he came to the middle of the Circle;
and there, seated at a table of red marble, was the Knight whom he had
come so far to seek, clad in his grass-green robes. And before him, on
the table, stood a wondrous goblet, fashioned from an emerald, and set
round the rim with blood-red rubies.",173,goblet,is a,piece_of_stemware,What's goblet?,Piece of stemware.

handed it to him with a stately bow, and Sir Gregory, being very
thirsty, drank.

And as he drank he noticed that the ale in the goblet never grew less,
but ever foamed up to the edge; and for the first time his heart misgave
him, and he wished that he had never set out on this strange adventure.

But, alas! the time for regrets had passed, for already a strange
numbness was stealing over his limbs, and a chill pallor was creeping
over his face, and before he could utter a single cry for help the
goblet dropped from his nerveless fingers, and he fell down before the
Elfin King like a dead man.

Then a great shout of triumph went up from all the company; for if there
was one thing which filled their hearts with joy, it was to entice some
unwary mortal into their Ring and throw their uncanny spell over him, so
that he must needs spend long years in their company.",47,thirsty,causes,buy_drink,What does thirsty cause?,Buy drink.

It was the sound of human footsteps, which were so free and untrammelled
that they knew at once that the stranger, whoever he was, was as yet
untouched by any charm. And if this were so he might work them ill, and
rescue their captive from them.

And what they dreaded was true; for it was the brave Earl St. Clair who
approached, fearless and strong because of the Holy Sign he bore.

about to step over its magic border, when the little grizzled Goblin who

here till seven long years be spent.

frost till dawn break and the hour cometh when they sing Matins in the

enchanted ground, and walked across it; and what was his astonishment to
find that all the ghostly Elves and Goblins whom he had seen, were lying
frozen into tiny blocks of ice, so that he was sore put to it to walk
amongst them without treading upon them.

And as he approached the marble table the very hairs rose on his head at
the sight of the Elfin King sitting behind it, stiff and stark like his
followers; while in front of him lay the form of Earl Gregory, who had
shared the same fate.

Nothing stirred, save two coal-black ravens, who sat, one on each side
of the table, as if to guard the emerald goblet, flapping their wings,
and croaking hoarsely.

When Earl St. Clair lifted the precious cup, they rose in the air and
circled round his head, screaming with rage, and threatening to dash it
from his hands with their claws; while the frozen Elves, and even their
mighty King himself stirred in their sleep, and half sat up, as if to
lay hands on this presumptuous intruder. But the Power of the Holy Sign

heard around him. The ravens shrieked, and the frozen Goblins screamed;
and up from the hidden lake below came the sound of the deep breathing
of the awful Monster who was lurking there, eager for prey.

But the brave Earl heeded none of these things, but kept steadily
onwards, trusting in the Might of the Sign he bore. And it carried him
safely through all the dangers; and just as the sound of the Matin Bell
was dying away in the morning air he stepped on to solid ground once
more, and flung the enchanted goblet from him.

And lo! every one of the frozen Elves vanished, along with their King
and his marble table, and nothing was left on the rank green grass save
Earl Gregory, who slowly woke from his enchanted slumber, and stretched
himself, and stood up, shaking in every limb. He gazed vaguely round
him, as if he scarce remembered where he was.

And when, after Earl St. Clair had run to him and had held him in his
arms till his senses returned and the warm blood coursed through his
veins, the two friends returned to the spot where Earl St. Clair had
thrown down the wondrous goblet, they found nothing but a piece of rough

the-enchanted-moccasins,1,"A long, long time ago, a little boy was living with his sister entirely alone in an uninhabited country, far out in the north-west. He was called the Boy that carries the Ball on his Back, from an idea that he possessed supernatural powers. This boy was in the habit of meditating alone, and asking within himself, whether there were other beings similar to themselves on the earth.

When he grew up to manhood, he inquired of his sister whether she knew of any human beings beside themselves. She replied that she did; and that there was, at a great distance, a large village.

As soon as he heard this, he said to his sister, ""I am now a young man and very much in want of a companion;"" and he asked his sister to make him several pairs of moccasins.

""My poor grandchild, I suppose you are one of those who seek for the distant village, from which no person has ever yet returned. Unless your guardian is more powerful than the guardians of those who have gone before you, you will share a similar fate to theirs. Be careful to provide yourself with the invisible bones they use in the medicine-dance, for without these you can not succeed.""

After she had thus spoken, she gave him the following directions for his journey:

""When you come near to the village which you seek, you will see in the center a large lodge, in which the chief of the village, who has two daughters, resides. Before the door there is a great tree, which is smooth and without bark. On this tree, about the height of a man from the ground, is hung a small lodge, in which these two false daughters dwell. It is here that so many have been destroyed, and among them your two elder brothers. Be wise, my grandchild, and abide strictly by my directions.""",9,wigwam,is a,lodge,What is a wigwam?,A wigwam is a small lodge.

Placing them in his bosom, Onwee Bahmondang, or the Wearer of the Ball, continued his journey, and kept eagerly on until he arrived at the village of which he was in search; and as he was gazing around him, he saw both the tree and the lodge which the old woman had mentioned.

He at once bent his steps for the tree, and approaching, he endeavored to reach the suspended lodge. But all his efforts were in vain; for as often as he attempted to reach it, the tree began to tremble, and it soon shot up so that the lodge could hardly be perceived.

He bethought him of his guardian, and invoking his aid, and changing himself into a squirrel, he mounted nimbly up again, in the hope that the lodge would not now escape him. Away shot the lodge, climb as briskly as he might.

Panting, and out of breath, he remembered the instructions of the old woman, and drawing from his bosom one of the bones, he thrust it into the trunk of the tree, and rested himself to be ready to start again.",14,secure,has subevent,guarantee,What does it mean to secure?,To secure means to guarantee safety.

At length the bones being all gone, and the lodge well-nigh out of sight, he began to despair, for the earth, too, had long since vanished entirely from his view.

Summoning his whole heart, he resolved to try once more. On and up he went, and, as soon as he put forth his hand to touch it, the tree again shook, and away went the lodge.

One more endeavor, brave Onwee, and in he goes; for having now reached the arch of heaven, the fly-away lodge could go no higher.

Onwee entered the lodge with a fearless step, and he beheld the two wicked sisters sitting opposite each other. He asked their names.

the-enchanted-moccasins,5,"After talking with them a little while, he discovered that whenever he addressed the one on his left hand, the tree would tremble as before and settle down to its former place; but when he addressed the one on his right hand, it would again shoot upward.

When he thus perceived that by addressing the one on his left hand that the tree would descend, he continued to do so until it had again settled down to its place near the earth. Then seizing his war-club, he said to the sisters:

""You who have caused the death of so many of my brethren I will now put an end to, and thus have revenge for those you have destroyed.""

As he spoke this he raised the club, and with one blow laid the two wicked women dead at his feet.

Onwee then descended, and learning that these sisters had a brother living with their father, who had shared all together in the spoils of all such as the wicked sisters had betrayed, and who would now pursue him for having put an end to their wicked profits, Onwee set off at random, not knowing whither he went.",90,seize,has subevent,take,What does it mean to seize?,To seize means to deliberately take hold of.
the-enchanted-moccasins,6,"The father coming in the evening to visit the lodge of his daughters, discovered what had happened. He immediately sent word to his son that his sisters had been slain, and that there were no more spoils to be had, which greatly inflamed the young man's temper, especially the woeful announcement at the close.

""The person who has done this,"" said the brother, as soon as he had reached the spot, chafing and half beside himself at the gloomy prospect of having no more travelers to strip, ""must be that boy who carries the ball on his back. I know his mode of going about his business, and since he would not allow himself to be killed by my sisters, he shall have the honor of dying by my hand. I will pursue him and have revenge.""

""It is well, my son,"" replied the father; ""the spirit of your life grant you success. I counsel you to be wary in the pursuit. Bahmondang is a cunning youth. It is a strong spirit who has put him on to do this injury to us, and he will try to deceive you in every way.

Nevertheless, he took up his weapons and departed in pursuit of Onwee Bahmondang, at the top of his speed.

Onwee finding that he was closely followed, climbed up into one of the tallest trees, and shot forth the magic arrows with which he had provided himself.

Seeing that his pursuer was not turned back by his arrows, Onwee renewed his flight; and when he found himself hard pressed, and his enemy close behind him, he transformed himself into the skeleton of a moose that had been killed, whose flesh had come off from his bones. He then remembered the moccasins which his sister had given him, and which were enchanted.

The angry brother at length came to the skeleton of the moose, when he perceived that the track he had been long pursuing did not stop there, so he continued to follow it up till he arrived at the end of the earth, where, for all his trouble, he found only a pair of moccasins.

Vexed that he had been outwitted by following a pair of moccasins instead of their owner, who was the object of his pursuit, he bitterly complained, resolving not to give up his revenge, and to be more wary in scrutinizing signs.

He then called to mind the skeleton he had met with on his way, and concluded that it must be the object of his search.",95,outwit,has subevent,surpass,What does it mean to outwit?,To outwit means to surpass someone in terms of wisdom.
the-enchanted-moccasins,9,"He retraced his steps toward the skeleton, but to his surprise it had disappeared, and the tracks of the wearer of the ball were in another direction. He now became faint with hunger, and lost heart; but when he remembered the blood of his sisters, and that he should not be allowed to enjoy a meal, nor so much as a mouthful, until he had put an end to Onwee Bahmondang, he plucked up his spirits and determined again to pursue.

Onwee, finding that he was closely followed, and that the hungry brother was approaching very fast, changed himself into a very old man, with two daughters, and living in a large lodge in the center of a beautiful garden, which was filled with every thing that could delight the eye, or was pleasant to the taste. He made himself appear so very old as to be unable to leave his lodge, and to require his daughters to bring him food and wait on him, as though he had been a mere child. The garden also had the appearance of old age, with its ancient bushes and hanging branches and decrepit vines loitering lazily about in the sun.",213,vine,is a,plant,What is vine?,Vine is a type of climbing plant that produces grapes.

But again he thought of the blood of his sisters, and what a fine appetite he would have if he should ever be allowed to eat any thing again, and once more he resolved to pursue, and to be content with nothing short of the amplest revenge.

He pushed on till he came to the beautiful garden. He advanced toward the lodge.

As soon as the fairy daughters perceived him they ran and told their father that a stranger approached.

Their father replied, ""Invite him in, my children, invite him in.""

They did so promptly, and, by the command of their father, they boiled some corn, and prepared several other palatable dishes. The savor was most delicious to the nostrils of the hungry brother, who had not the least suspicion of the sport that was going on at his expense.

He was faint and weary with travel, and he felt that he could endure fasting no longer; for his appetite was terribly inflamed by the sight of the choice food that was steaming before him.",12,sink,is at location of,kitchen,Where can we find a sink?,In a kitchen or bathroom.

He ate so keenly, and came and went to the choice dishes so often, that drowsiness at length overpowered him, and he soon fell into a profound sleep.

Onwee Bahmondang watched his opportunity, and as soon as he saw that the false brother's sleep was sound, he resumed his youthful form, and sent off the two fairy daughters and the old garden; and drawing the magic-ball from his back, which turned out to be a great war-club, he fetched the slumbering brother a mighty blow, which sent him away too; and thus did Onwee Bahmondang vindicate his title as the Wearer of the Ball.",104,FALSE,is the antonym of,TRUE,What is the opposite of true?,False.
the-enchanted-moccasins,12,"When Onwee swung around, with the great force and weight of the club with which he had dispatched the brother of the two wicked women, he found himself in a large village, surrounded by a great crowd of people. At the door of a beautiful lodge stood his sister, smiling, and ready to invite him in. Onwee entered, and hanging up his war-club and the enchanted moccasins, which he had recovered, he rested from his labors, and smoked his evening pipe, with the admiration and approval of the whole world.

With one exception only, Onwee Bahmondang had the hearty praises of all the people.

Now it happened that there lived in this same village an envious and boastful fellow, who had been once a chief, but coming home always badly whipped, he was put out of office, and now spent his time about the place mainly, in proclaiming certain great things which he had in his eye, and which he meant to do-one of these days.",167,proclaim,has subevent,declare,What does it mean to proclaim?,To proclaim means to announce or declare.
the-enchanted-moccasins,13,"This man's name was Ko-ko, the Owl; and hearing much of the wonderful achievements of the Wearer of the Ball, Ko-ko put on a big look, and announced that he was going to do something extraordinary himself.

Onwee Bahmondang, he said, had not half done his work, and he, Ko-ko, meant to go on the ground and finish it up as it should be.

He began by procuring an oak ball, which he thrust down his back, and, confident in its magical powers, he, too, called himself the Wearer of the Ball. In fact it was the self-same ball that Onwee had employed, except that the magic had entirely gone out of it. Coming by night in the shadow of the lodge, he thrust his arm in at the door, and stealthily possessed himself of the enchanted moccasins. He would have taken away Onwee's war-club too, if he could have carried it; but although he was twice the size and girth of Onwee, he had not the strength to lift it; so he borrowed a club from an old chief, who was purblind, and mistook Ko-ko for his brother who was a brave man; and raising a terrible tumult with his voice, and a great dust with his heels, Ko-ko set out.

He had traveled all day, when he came to a small wigwam, and on looking into it, he discovered a very old woman sitting alone by the fire; just as Onwee had before.",81,oak,is a,tree,What is an oak?,An oak is a deciduous tree with distinctive deeply lobed leaves.

""I want to find the lodge with the wicked young women in it, who slay travellers and steal their trappings,"" answered Ko-ko.

""You mean the two young women who lived in the flying lodge?"" said the old woman.

""The same,"" answered Ko-ko. ""I am going to kill them.""

With this he gave a great flourish with his borrowed club, and looked desperate and murderous as he could.

""They were slain yesterday by the Wearer of the Ball,"" said the old woman.

Ko-ko looked around for the door in a very owlish way, and heaving a short hem from his chest, he acknowledged that he had heard something to that effect down in one of the villages.

""But there's the brother. I'll have a chance at him,"" said Ko-ko.

""He is dead too,"" said the old woman.

""Is there nobody then left for me to kill?"" cried Ko-ko. ""Must I then go back without any blood upon my hands?""

He made as if he could shed tears over his sad mishap.

""The father is still living; and you will find him in the lodge, if you have a mind to call on him. He would like to see the Owl,"" the old woman added.

""He shall,"" replied Ko-ko. ""Have you any bones about the house; for I suppose I shall have to climb that tree.""

""Oh, yes; plenty,"" answered the old woman. ""You can have as many as you want.""",240,mishap,is a,misfortune,What is mishap?,Mishap is misfortune.
the-enchanted-moccasins,15,"And she gave him a handful of fish-bones, which Ko-ko, taking them to be the Invisible Tallies which had helped Onwee Bahmondang in climbing the magical tree, thrust into his bosom.

""Thank you,"" said Ko-ko; taking up his club and striding toward the door.

""Will you not have a little advice,"" said the old woman. ""This is a dangerous business you are going on.""

Ko-ko turned about and laughed to scorn the proposal, and putting forth his right foot from the lodge first, an observance in which he had great hopes, he started for the lodge of the wicked father.

Ko-ko ran very fast, as if he feared he should lose the chance of massacring any member of the wicked family, until he came in sight of the lodge hanging upon the tree.

He then slackened his pace, and crept forward with a wary eye lest somebody might chance to be looking out at the door. All was, however, still up there; and Ko-ko clasped the tree and began to climb.

Away went the lodge, and up went Ko-ko, puffing and panting, after it. And it was not a great while before the Owl had puffed and panted away all the wind he had to spare; and yet the lodge kept flying aloft, higher, higher. What was to be done!",33,bosom,is a,breast,What is bosom?,Bosom is the breast or chest of a human or animal.
the-enchanted-moccasins,16,"Ko-ko of course bethought him of the bones, for that was just what, as he knew, had occurred to Onwee Bahmondang under the like circumstances.

He had the bones in his bosom; and now it was necessary for him to be a squirrel. He immediately called on several guardian spirits whom he knew of by name, and requested them to convert him into a squirrel. But not one of all them seemed to pay the slightest attention to his request; for there he hung, the same heavy-limbed, big-headed, be-clubbed, and be-blanketed Ko-ko as ever.

He then desired that they would turn him into an opossum; an application which met with the same luck as the previous one. After this he petitioned to be a wolf, a gophir, a dog, or a bear-if they would be so obliging. The guardian spirits were either all deaf, or indifferent to his wishes, or absent on some other business.

Ko-ko, in spite of all his begging and supplication and beseeching, was obliged to be still Ko-ko.

""The bones, however,"" he said, to himself, ""are good. I shall get a nice rest, at any rate, if I am forced to climb as I am.""

With this he drew out one of the bones from his bosom, and shouting aloud, ""Ho! ho! who is there?"" he thrust it into the trunk of the tree, and would have indulged himself in a rest; but being no more than a common fish-bone, without the slightest savor of magic in it, it snapped with Ko-ko, who came tumbling down, with the door of the lodge which he had shaken loose, rattling after him.",163,deaf,is a,people,What is a deaf?,A deaf is a person who is unable to hear.
the-enchanted-moccasins,17,"""Ho! ho! who is there?"" cried the wicked father, making his appearance at the opening and looking down.

""It is I, Onwee Bahmondang!"" cried Ko-koor, thinking to frighten the wicked father.

""Ah! it is you, is it? I will be there presently,"" called the old man. ""Do not be in haste to go away!""

Ko-ko, observing that the old man was in earnest, scrambled up from the ground, and set off promptly at his highest rate of speed.

When he looked back and saw that the wicked father was gaining upon him, Ko-koor mounted a tree, as had Onwee Bahmondang before, and fired off a number of arrows, but as they were no more than common arrows, he got nothing by it, but was obliged to descend, and run again for life.

As he hurried on he encountered the skeleton of a moose, into which he would have transformed himself, but not having the slightest confidence in any one of all the guardians who should have helped him, he passed on.

The wicked father was hot in pursuit, and Ko-koor was suffering terribly for lack of wind, when luckily he remembered the enchanted moccasins. He could not send them to the end of the earth, as had Onwee Bahmondang.",174,skeleton,is at location of,closet,"What does ""skeleton in the closet"" means?",It refers to secrets that cannot bear the light of day.
the-enchanted-moccasins,18,"""I will improve on that dull fellow,"" said Ko-ko. ""I will put them on myself.""

Accordingly, Ko-ko had just time to draw on the moccasins when the wicked father came in sight.

""Go now!"" cried Ko-ko, giving orders to the enchanted moccasins; and go they did; but to the astonishment of the Owl, they turned immediately about in the way in which the wicked father, now, very furious, was approaching.

""The other way! the other way!"" cried Ko-ko.

Cry as loud as he would, the enchanted moccasins would keep on in their own course; and before he could shake himself out of them, they had run him directly into the face of the wicked father.

""What do you mean, you Owl?"" cried the wicked father, falling upon Ko-ko with a huge club, and counting his ribs at every stroke.

""I can not help it, good man,"" answered Ko-ko. ""I tried my best-""

Ko-ko would have gone the other way, but the enchanted moccasins kept hurrying him forward. ""Stand off, will you?"" cried the old man.

By this time, allowing the wicked father chance to bestow no more than five-and-twenty more blows upon Ko-ko, the moccasins were taking him past.

""Stop!"" cried the old man again. ""You are running away. Ho! ho! you are a coward!""

""I am not, good man,"" answered Ko-ko, carried away by the magical shoes, ""I assure you."" But ere he could finish his avowal, the moccasins had hurried him out of sight.

A party of hunters passing that way after several days, found Ko-ko sitting among the bushes, looking greatly bewildered; and when they inquired of him how he had succeeded with the wicked father at the lodge, he answered that he had demolished the whole establishment, but that his name was not Ko-ko, but Onwee Bahmondang; saying which, he ran away into the woods, and was never seen more.",95,demolish,has subevent,destroy,What does it mean to demolish?,To demolish means to destroy.

'And what may that be?' asked Manawyddan.

'It is that thou marry my mother Rhiannon and become lord of the fair
lands that I will give her for dowry. Never did any lady have more wit

would not be parted from each other by night or by day, so great was the
love between them.

One day, when they were returned, they were sitting out in a green
place. Suddenly the crash of thunder struck loudly on their ears. A wall of mist fell between them, so that they were hidden one from
the other. Trembling they sat till the darkness fled and the light shone
again upon them. In the place where they were wont to see cattle,

For a year these four fed on the meat that Manawyddan and Pryderi killed
out hunting, and the honey of the bees that sucked the mountain heather.

grew weary.

'We cannot spend our lives thus,' said Manawyddan at last, 'let us go
into England and learn some trade by which we may live.' So they
left Wales, and went to Hereford. There they made saddles, while

likewise they enamelled. And so greatly did they prosper that no man
in the town bought a shield except they had made it. The
shield-makers banded together as the saddlers had done, and resolved to
slay them. But of this they had warning, and by night betook themselves
to another town.

'Let us take to making shoes,' said Manawyddan, 'for there are not any
among the shoemakers bold enough to fight us.'

'I know nothing of making shoes,' answered Pryderi, who in truth
despised so peaceful a craft.

will buy the leather ready dressed, and will make the shoes from it.'",29,likewise,has context of,manner,What's the meaming of likewise?,Likewise means being in a similar manner.
the-escape-of-the-mouse,6,"Then straightway he sought the town for the best leather, and for a
goldsmith to fashion the clasps. He himself watched till it was
done, so that he might learn for himself. Soon he became known as 'The
Maker of Gold Shoes,' and prospered so greatly, that as long as one
could be bought from him not a shoe was purchased from the shoemakers
of the town. And the craftsmen were wroth, and banded together to slay
them.

'Pryderi,' said Manawyddan, when he had received news of it, 'we will
not remain in England any longer. Let us set forth to Dyved.'

So they journeyed until they came to their lands at Narberth. There they
gathered their dogs round them, and hunted for a year as before.",14,goldsmith,is a,worker,What is a goldsmith?,A goldsmith is a worker who makes and sells things out of gold.
the-escape-of-the-mouse,7,"After that a strange thing happened. One morning Pryderi and Manawyddan
rose up to hunt, and loosened their dogs, which ran before them. They came to a small bush. At the bush, the dogs shrank away as if
frightened. They returned to their masters, their hair brisling on their
backs.

'We must see what is in that bush,' said Pryderi, and what was in it was
a boar, with a skin as white as the snow on the mountains. And he came
out, and made a stand as the dogs rushed on him, driven on by the men.
Long he stood at bay. Then at last he betook himself to flight, and fled
to a castle which was newly built, in a place where no building had ever
been known. Into the castle he ran, and the dogs after him, and long
though their masters looked and listened. They neither saw nor heard
aught concerning dogs or boar.",79,boar,is a,pig,What is a boar?,A boar is a wild ancestor of pigs.
the-escape-of-the-mouse,8,"'I will go into the castle and get tidings of the dogs,' said Pryderi at
last.

'Truly,' answered Manawyddan, 'thou wouldst do unwisely, for whosoever
has cast a spell over this land has set this castle here.'

'I cannot give up my dogs,' replied Pryderi, and to the castle he went.",54,dog,desires,bone,What do dogs like to eat?,Dogs like to eat bones.
the-escape-of-the-mouse,9,"But within was neither man nor beast; neither boar nor dogs, but only
a fountain with marble round it, and on the edge a golden bowl, richly
wrought, which pleased Pryderi greatly. In a moment he forgot about his
dogs, and went up to the bowl and took hold of it. His hands
stuck to the bowl, and his feet to the marble slab, and despair took
possession of him.

Till the close of day Manawyddan waited for him. When the sun was
fast sinking, he went home, thinking that he had strayed far.

'Where are thy friend and thy dogs?' said Rhiannon, and he told her what
had befallen Pryderi.

'A good friend hast thou lost,' answered Rhiannon, and she went up to
the castle and through the gate, which was open. There, in the centre of
the courtyard, she beheld Pryderi standing, and hastened towards him.",16,fountain,is at location of,courtyard,Where can we find fountains?,We can find fountains in courtyards.
the-escape-of-the-mouse,10,"'What dost thou here?' she asked, laying her hand on the bowl. As
she spoke she too stuck fast, and was not able to utter a word. Then
thunder was heard and a veil of darkness descended upon them. The
castle vanished and they with it.

When Kieva, the wife of Pryderi, found that neither her husband nor
his mother returned to her, she was in such sorrow that she cared not
whether she lived or died. Manawyddan was grieved also in his heart, and
said to her:

'It is not fitting that we should stay here. He have lost our dogs
and cannot get food. Let us go into England--it is easier for us to live
there.' So they set forth.",14,bowl,is at location of,cupboard,Where do we keep bowls in the kitchen?,We keep bowls in a cupboard.
the-escape-of-the-mouse,11,"'What craft wilt thou follow?' asked Kieva as they went along.

'I shall make shoes as once I did,' replied he. He got all the
finest leather in the town and caused gilded clasps to be made for the
shoes, till everyone flocked to buy. All the shoemakers in the
town were idle and banded together in anger to kill him. But luckily
Manawyddan got word of it. He and Kieva left the town one night and
proceeded to Narberth. He took with him a sheaf of wheat, which he sowed
in three plots of ground. And while the wheat was growing up, he hunted
and fished. They had food enough and to spare. Thus the months
passed until the harvest. One evening Manawyddan visited the
furthest of his fields of wheat; and saw that it was ripe.",33,leather,is a,material,What is leather?,Leather is a tough material made from animal skin.
the-escape-of-the-mouse,12,"'To-morrow I will reap this,' said he. On the morrow when he went to

Filled with dismay he hastened to the second field. There the corn
was ripe and golden.

'To-morrow I will reap this,' he said. On the morrow the ears had
gone, and there was nothing but the bare straw.

'Well, there is still one field left,' he said, and when he looked
at it, it was still fairer than the other two. 'To-night I will watch
here,' thought he. 'Whosoever carried off the other corn will in
like manner take this. I will know who it is.' So he hid himself and
waited.",40,corn,is a,vegetable,What is corn?,"Corn is a popular, delicious vegetable."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,13,"The hours slid by, and all was still, so still that Manawyddan well-nigh
dropped asleep. But at midnight there arose the loudest tumult in the
world, and peeping out he beheld a mighty host of mice, which could
neither be numbered nor measured. Each mouse climbed up a straw till
it bent down with its weight. Then it bit off one of the ears, and
carried it away. There was not one of the straws that had not got a
mouse to it.

Full of wrath he rushed at the mice. He could no more come up with
them than if they had been gnats, or birds of the air, save one only
which lingered behind the rest, and this mouse Manawyddan came up with.
Stooping down he seized it by the tail, and put it in his glove, and
tied a piece of string across the opening of the glove, so that the
mouse could not escape. When he entered the hall where Kieva was
sitting, he lighted a fire, and hung the glove up on a peg.",199,peg,is a,holder,What is a peg?,A peg is a holder often used for hanging clothes.
the-escape-of-the-mouse,14,"'What hast thou there?' asked she.

'A thief,' he answered, 'that I caught robbing me.'

'What kind of a thief may it be which thou couldst put in thy glove?'
said Kieva.

'That I will tell thee,' he replied. Then he showed her how his
fields of corn had been wasted, and how he had watched for the mice.

but let it go.'

'Woe betide me,' he cried, 'if I would not hang them all if I could
catch them, and such as I have I will hang.'

'Verily,' said she, 'there is no reason I should succour this reptile,
except to prevent discredit unto thee.'

'If I knew any cause that I should succour it, I would take thy
counsel,' answered Manawyddan, 'but I know of none. I am minded to
destroy it.'

the-escape-of-the-mouse,16,"So he went up a hill and set up two forks on the top. While he
was doing this he saw a scholar coming towards him, whose clothes were
tattered. Now it was seven years since Manawyddan had seen man or beast
in that place, and the sight amazed him.

'Good day to thee, my lord,' said the scholar.

'Good greeting to thee, scholar. Whence dost thou come?'

'From singing in England; but wherefore dost thou ask?'

to touch a reptile like this. Let it go free.'

'I will not let it go free,' cried Manawyddan. 'I caught it robbing me,
and it shall suffer the doom of a thief.'

'Lord!' said the scholar, 'sooner than see a man like thee at such a
work. I would give thee a pound which I have received as alms to let it
go free.'

about to draw it tight. A bishop, with a great following and horses
bearing huge packs, came by.

the-escape-of-the-mouse,24,"'To despoil thee,' replied the bishop. 'It is I who cast the charm
over thy lands, to avenge Gwawl the son of Clud my friend. And it was I
who threw the spell upon Pryderi to avenge Gwawl for the trick that had
been played on him in the game of Badger in the Bag. And not only was I
wroth, but my people likewise. When it was known that thou wast come
to dwell in the land, they besought me much to change them into mice,
that they might eat thy corn. The first and the second nights it was
the men of my own house that destroyed thy two fields. On the third
night my wife and her ladies came to me. They begged me to change them
also into the shape of mice, that they might take part in avenging
Gwawl. Therefore I changed them. Yet had she not been ill and slow of
foot, thou couldst not have overtaken her. Still, since she was caught,

huts for the people to dwell in. And he was satisfied in his soul, but
one more question he put to the bishop.

But when he reached his home he was speedily undeceived. For his wife
looked at him as if he were a ghost, and the children whom he had left
wee, toddling things were now well-grown boys and girls, who stared at
him as if he had been an utter stranger.

the-fairy-nurse,1,"There was once a little farmer and his wife living near Coolgarrow. They
had three children, and my story happened while the youngest was a baby.
The wife was a good wife enough, but her mind was all on her family and
her farm, and she hardly ever went to her knees without falling asleep,
and she thought the time spent in the chapel was twice as long as it
need be. So, friends, she let her man and her two children go before
her one day to Mass, while she called to consult a fairy man about a
disorder one of her cows had. She was late at the chapel, and was sorry
all the day after, for her husband was in grief about it, and she was
very fond of him.

Late that night he was wakened up by the cries of his children calling
out 'Mother! Mother!' When he sat up and rubbed his eyes, there was no
wife by his side, and when he asked the little ones what was become of
their mother, they said they saw the room full of nice little men and
women, dressed in white and red and green, and their mother in the
middle of them, going out by the door as if she was walking in her
sleep. Out he ran, and searched everywhere round the house but, neither

they'd be bad enough only for a kind neighbour that used to look in
whenever she could spare time. The infant was away with a nurse.

the grass and a knock at the door, and there, when I came out, was a
fine-looking dark man, mounted on a black horse, and he told me to get
ready in all haste, for a lady was in great want of me. As soon as I put
on my cloak and things, he took me by the hand, and I was sitting behind
him before I felt myself stirring. ""Where are we going, sir?"" says I.
""You'll soon know,"" says he; and he drew his fingers across my eyes,
and not a ray could I see. I kept a tight grip of him, and I little knew
whether he was going backwards or forwards, or how long we were about
it, till my hand was taken again, and I felt the ground under me. The
fingers went the other way across my eyes, and there we were before
a castle door, and in we went through a big hall and great rooms all
painted in fine green colours, with red and gold bands and ornaments,
and the finest carpets and chairs and tables and window curtains, and
grand ladies and gentlemen walking about. At last we came to a bedroom,
with a beautiful lady in bed, with a fine bouncing boy beside her. The
lady clapped her hands, and in came the Dark Man and kissed her and the

cave, with water oozing over the edges of the stones and through the
clay; and the lady, and the lord, and the child weazened, poverty-bitten
creatures--nothing but skin and bone--and the rich dresses were old
rags. I didn't let on that I found any difference, and after a bit says
the Dark Man, ""Go before me to the hall door, and I will be with you in
a few moments, and see you safe home."" Well, just as I turned into the
outside cave, who should I see watching near the door but poor Molly.

brought here to nurse the child of the king and queen of the fairies;

near Templeshambo next Friday night, on a visit to the fairies of Old
Ross. If John can catch me by the hand or cloak when I ride by, and has

have no suspicion of me. When we came out I looked about me, and where
do you think we were but in the dyke of the Rath of Cromogue. I was
on the horse again, which was nothing but a big rag-weed, and I was
in dread every minute I'd fall off; but nothing happened till I found
myself in my own cabin. The king slipped five guineas into my hand as
soon as I was on the ground, and thanked me, and bade me good night. I
hope I'll never see his face again. I got into bed, and couldn't sleep
for a long time; and when I examined my five guineas this morning, that
I left in the table drawer the last thing, I found five withered leaves
of oak--bad luck to the giver!

Well, you may all think the fright, and the joy, and the grief the
poor man was in when the woman finished her story. They talked and they

as silent as the grave, and the poor woman lying in a faint in the arms
of her husband and her good neighbour. Well, all in good time she was

the-fir-tree,1,"There was once a pretty little fir-tree in a wood. It was in a capital position, for it could get sun, and there was enough air, and all around grew many tall companions, both pines and firs. It did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air, or notice the little peasant children who ran about chattering when they came out to gather wild strawberries and raspberries. Often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw; they would sit down by the little fir-tree and say, 'What a pretty little one this is!' The tree did not like that at all.

The birds would build their nests in my branches, and when the wind blew I would bow to it politely just like the others!' It took no pleasure in the sunshine, nor in the birds, nor in the rose-coloured clouds that sailed over it at dawn and at sunset. Then the winter came, and the snow lay white and sparkling all around, and a hare would come and spring right over the little fir-tree, which annoyed it very much. But when two more winters had passed the fir-tree was so tall that the hare had to run round it. 'Ah! to grow and grow, and become great and old! that is the only pleasure in life,' thought the tree. In the autumn the woodcutters used to come and hew some of the tallest trees; this happened every year, and the young fir-tree would shiver as the magnificent trees fell crashing and crackling to the ground, their branches hewn off, and the great trunks left bare, so that they were almost unrecognisable.

'Oh! if I were only big enough to sail away over the sea too! What sort of thing is the sea? what does it look like?'

'Oh! it would take much too long to tell you all that,' said the stork, and off he went.

These little trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept all their branches; they were put in carts and drawn out of the wood by horses.

'Whither are those going?' asked the fir-tree; 'they are no bigger than I, and one there was much smaller even! Why do they keep their branches? Where are they taken to?'

'We know! we know!' twittered the sparrows. 'Down there in the city we have peeped in at the windows, we know where they go! They attain to the greatest splendour and magnificence you can imagine! We have looked in at the windows and seen them planted in the middle of the warm room and adorned with the most beautiful things-golden apples, sweet-meats, toys and hundreds of candles.'

And at Christmas-time it was the first to be cut down. The axe went deep into the pith; the tree fell to the ground with a groan; it felt bruised and faint. It could not think of happiness, it was sad at leaving its home, the spot where it had sprung up; it knew, too, that it would never see again its dear old companions, or the little shrubs and flowers, perhaps not even the birds. Altogether the parting was not pleasant.

There were pictures hanging on the walls, and near the Dutch stove stood great Chinese vases with lions on their lids; there were armchairs, silk-covered sofas, big tables laden with picture-books and toys, worth hundreds of pounds-at least, so the children said. The fir-tree was placed in a great tub filled with sand, but no one could see that it was a tub, for it was all hung with greenery and stood on a gay carpet. How the tree trembled! What was coming now? On its branches they hung little nets cut out of coloured paper, each full of sugarplums; gilt apples and nuts hung down as if they were growing, over a hundred red, blue, and white tapers were fastened among the branches.

'Ah!' thought the tree, 'if it were only evening! Then the tapers would soon be lighted. What will happen then? I wonder whether the trees will come from the wood to see me, or if the sparrows will fly against the window panes? Am I to stand here decked out thus through winter and summer?'

It was not a bad guess, but the fir-tree had real bark-ache from sheer longing, and bark-ache in trees is just as bad as head-ache in human beings.

Now the tapers were lighted. What a glitter! What splendour! The tree quivered in all its branches so much, that one of the candles caught the green, and singed it. 'Take care!' cried the young ladies, and they extinguished it.

Now the tree did not even dare to quiver. It was really terrible! It was so afraid of losing any of its ornaments, and it was quite bewildered by all the radiance.

And then the folding doors were opened, and a crowd of children rushed in, as though they wanted to knock down the whole tree, whilst the older people followed soberly. The children stood quite silent, but only for a moment, and then they shouted again, and danced round the tree, and snatched off one present after another.",137,candle,is at location of,birthday_cake,What do we put on birthday cakes?,We put candles on birthday cakes.
the-fir-tree,9,"'What are they doing?' thought the tree. 'What is going to happen?' And the tapers burnt low on the branches, and were put out one by one, and then the children were given permission to plunder the tree. They rushed at it so that all its boughs creaked; if it had not been fastened by the gold star at the top to the ceiling, it would have been overthrown.

The children danced about with their splendid toys, and no one looked at the tree, except the old nurse, who came and peeped amongst the boughs, just to see if a fig or an apple had been forgotten.

'A story! a story!' cried the children, and dragged a little stout man to the tree; he sat down beneath it, saying, 'Here we are in the greenwood, and the tree will be delighted to listen! But I am only going to tell one story. Shall it be Henny Penny or Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs, and yet gained great honour and married a princess?'

'Henny Penny!' cried some; 'Humpty Dumpty!' cried others; there was a perfect babel of voices! Only the fir-tree kept silent, and thought, 'Am I not to be in it? Am I to have nothing to do with it?'",42,plunder,has subevent,take,What does it mean to plunder?,To plunder means to take by force.

The fir-tree stood quite astonished and thoughtful; the birds in the wood had never related anything like that. 'Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs and yet married a princess! yes, that is the way of the world!' thought the tree, and was sure it must be true, because such a nice man had told the story. 'Well, who knows? Perhaps I shall fall downstairs and marry a princess.' And it rejoiced to think that next day it would be decked out again with candles, toys, glittering ornaments, and fruits. 'To-morrow I shall quiver again with excitement. I shall enjoy to the full all my splendour. To-morrow I shall hear Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps Henny Penny too.'

'What am I to do here? What is there for me to hear?' And it leant against the wall, and thought and thought. And there was time enough for that, for days and nights went by, and no one came; at last when some one did come, it was only to put some great boxes into the corner.

Only I wish it were not so terribly dark and lonely here; not even a little hare! It was so nice out in the wood, when the snow lay all around, and the hare leapt past me; yes, even when he leapt over me: but I didn't like it then. It's so dreadfully lonely up here.'

'Where do you come from?' asked the mice, 'and what do you know?' They were extremely inquisitive. 'Do tell us about the most beautiful place in the world. Is that where you come from? Have you been in the storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling, where one dances on tallow candles, and where one goes in thin and comes out fat?'

'I know nothing about that,' said the tree. 'But I know the wood, where the sun shines, and the birds sing.' And then it told them all about its young days, and the little mice had never heard anything like that before, and they listened with all their ears, and said: 'Oh, how much you have seen! How lucky you have been!'

'I?' said the fir-tree, and then it thought over what it had told them. 'Yes, on the whole those were very happy times.' But then it went on to tell them about Christmas Eve, when it had been adorned with sweet-meats and tapers.

'Oh!' said the little mice, 'how lucky you have been, you old fir-tree!'

But they may come again. Humpty dumpty fell downstairs, and yet he married a princess; perhaps I shall also marry a princess!' And then it thought of a pretty little birch-tree that grew out in the wood, and seemed to the fir-tree a real princess, and a very beautiful one too.

'Who is Humpty Dumpty?' asked the little mice.

And then the tree told the whole story; it could remember every single word, and the little mice were ready to leap on to the topmost branch out of sheer joy!",131,remember,has subevent,write_down,What should we do if we wish to remember something?,We should write it down.

'Is that the only story you know?' asked the rats.

'The only one,' answered the tree. 'I heard that on my happiest evening, but I did not realise then how happy I was.'

'That's a very poor story. Don't you know one about bacon or tallow candles? a storeroom story?'

'No,' said the tree.

'Then we are much obliged to you,' said the rats, and they went back to their friends.

At last the little mice went off also, and the tree said, sighing: 'Really it was very pleasant when the lively little mice sat round and listened whilst I told them stories. But now that's over too. But now I will think of the time when I shall be brought out again, to keep up my spirits.'",95,bacon,is a,pork,What is bacon?,"Bacon is pork from a particular part, usually the sides, belly or back."
the-fir-tree,16,"But when did that happen? Well, it was one morning when they came to tidy up the lumber-room; they threw it really rather roughly on the floor, but a servant dragged it off at once downstairs, where there was daylight once more.

'Now life begins again!' thought the tree. It felt the fresh air, the first rays of the sun, and there it was out in the yard! Everything passed so quickly; the tree quite forgot to notice itself, there was so much to look at all around. The yard opened on a garden full of flowers; the roses were so fresh and sweet, hanging over a little trellis, the lime-trees were in blossom, and the swallows flew about, saying: 'Quirre-virre-vil, my husband has come home;' but it was not the fir-tree they meant.

'Now I shall live,' thought the tree joyfully, stretching out its branches wide; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow; and it was lying in a corner among weeds and nettles. The golden star was still on its highest bough, and it glittered in the bright sunlight. In the yard some of the merry children were playing, who had danced so gaily round the tree at Christmas. One of the little ones ran up, and tore off the gold star.

'Look what was left on the ugly old fir-tree!' he cried, and stamped on the boughs so that they cracked under his feet.",197,nettle,is a,weed,What is nettle?,Nettle is a kind of weed.
the-fir-tree,17,"And the tree looked at all the splendour and freshness of the flowers in the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished that it had been left lying in the dark corner of the lumber-room; it thought of its fresh youth in the wood, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the little mice who had listened so happily to the story of Humpty Dumpty.

'Too late! Too late!' thought the old tree. 'If only I had enjoyed myself whilst I could. Now all is over and gone.'

And a servant came and cut the tree into small pieces, there was quite a bundle of them; they flickered brightly under the great copper in the brew-house; the tree sighed deeply, and each sigh was like a pistol-shot; so the children who were playing there ran up, and sat in front of the fire, gazing at it, and crying, 'Piff! puff! bang!' But for each report, which was really a sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer's day in the wood, or of a winter's night out there, when the stars were shining; it thought of Christmas Eve, and of Humpty Dumpty, which was the only story it had heard, or could tell, and then the tree had burnt away.

The children played on in the garden, and the youngest had the golden star on his breast, which the tree had worn on the happiest evening of its life; and now that was past-and the tree had passed away-and the story too, all ended and done with.

the-fire-plume,1,"Wassamo was living with his parents on the shore of a large bay, far out
in the north-east.

One day, when the season had commenced for fish to be plenty, the mother
of Wassamo said to him, ""My son, I wish you would go to yonder point and
see if you can not procure me some fish; and ask your cousin to
accompany you.""

He did so. They set out, and in the course of the afternoon they arrived
at the fishing-ground.

The cousin, being the elder, attended to the nets, and they encamped
near by, using the bark of the birch for a lodge to shelter them through
the night.

They lit a fire, and while they sat conversing with each other, the moon
arose. Not a breath of wind disturbed the smooth surface of the lake.
Not a cloud was seen. Wassamo looked out on the water toward their nets,
and he saw that the little black spots, which were no other than the
floats, dotting the lake, had disappeared.

""Cousin,"" he said, ""let us visit our nets; perhaps we are fortunate.""",8,shore,has property,next_to_sea,What do we know about shores?,Shores are next to sea.

white, all over, with the glittering prey. They landed in fine spirits,
and put away their canoe in safety from the winds.

""Wassamo,"" said the cousin, ""you cook that we may eat.""

Wassamo set about the work at once, and soon had his great kettle swung
upon its branch, while the cousin lay at his ease upon the other side of
the fire.

""Cousin,"" said Wassamo, ""tell me stories or sing me some love-songs.""

The cousin obeyed, and sung his plaintive songs; or he would frequently
break off in the midst of a mournful chant, and begin to recite a
mirthful story, and then in the midst of Wassamo's laughter he would
return to the plaintive ditty--just as it suited his fancy; for the
cousin was gay of spirit, and shifted his humor faster than the fleecy
clouds that appeared and disappeared in the night-sky over their heads.
In this changeful pastime the cousin ran his length, and then he fell
away, murmuring parts of his song or story, into a silvery sleep; with
the moon gliding through the branches and gilding his face.",137,recite,has subevent,repeat,What is recite?,Recite is when you repeat aloud something.
the-fire-plume,3,"Wassamo in the mean while had lost the sound of his cousin's voice in
the rich simmer of the kettle; and when its music pleased his ear the
most, as announcing that the fish were handsomely cooked, he lifted the
kettle from the fire. He spoke to his cousin, but he received no answer.

He went on with his housekeeping alone, and took the wooden ladle and
skimmed the kettle neatly, for the fish were very plump and fat. Wassamo
had a torch of twisted bark in one hand to give light, and when he came
to take out the fish, there was no one to have charge of the torch.

The cousin was so happy in his sleep, with the silver moon kissing his
cheeks, as though she were enamored of his fair looks, that Wassamo had
not the heart to call him up.

Binding his girdle upon his brow, in this he thrust the torch, and went
forward, with the light dancing through the green leaves at every turn
of his head, to prepare the evening meal.

He again spoke to his cousin, but gently, to learn whether he was in
truth asleep. The cousin murmured, but made no reply; and Wassamo
stepped softly about with the dancing fire-plume lighting up the gloom
of the forest at every turn he made.",20,kettle,is used for,boil_water,What are kettles usually used for?,Kettles are usually used for boiling water.

""Cousin,"" said Wassamo, ""some person is near us. I hear a laugh; awake
and let us look out!""

The cousin made no answer.

Again Wassamo heard the laughter in mirthful repetition, like the ripple
of the water-brook upon the shining pebbles of the stream. Peering out
as far as the line of the torchlight pierced into the darkness, he
beheld two beautiful young females smiling on him. Their countenances
appeared to be perfectly white, like the fresh snow.

He crouched down and pushed his cousin, saying, in a low voice, ""Awake!
awake! here are two young women.""

But he received no answer. His cousin seemed lost to all earthly sense
and sound; for he lay unmoved, smiling, in the calm light of the moon.
Wassamo started up alone, and glided toward the strange females.

As he approached them he was more and more enraptured with their beauty;
but just as he was about to speak to them, he suddenly fell to the

of the fish he observed were in the bowl. The fire flickered, and made
light and shadow; but nowhere was Wassamo to be seen. He waited, and
waited again, in the expectation that Wassamo would appear.

""Perhaps,"" thought the cousin, ""he is gone out again to visit the nets.""

He looked off that way, but the canoe still lay close by the rock at the
shore. He searched and found his footsteps in the ashes, and out upon
the green ground a little distance, and then they were utterly lost.

He was now greatly troubled in spirit, and he called aloud, ""Netawis!
cousin! cousin!"" but there was no answer to his call. He called again in
his sorrow, louder and louder, ""Netawis! Netawis! cousin! cousin!
whither are you gone?"" But no answer came to his voice of wailing. He
started for the edge of the woods, crying as he ran, ""My cousin!"" and
""Oh, my cousin!""

would answer him, he burst into tears, and sobbed aloud.",31,flicker,is a,flash,What is a fire flicker?,A fire flicker is a unsteady flash of light.

Wassamo with a sorely-troubled heart. ""He may have been playing me a
trick,"" he thought; but it was full time that the trick should be at an
end, and Wassamo returned not. The cousin cherished other hopes, but
they all died away in the morning light, when he found himself alone by
the hunting-fire.

""How shall I answer to his friends for Wassamo?"" thought the cousin.
""Although,"" he said to himself, ""his parents are my kindred, and they
are well assured that their son is my bosom-friend, will they receive
that belief in the place of him who is lost. No, no; they will say that
I have slain him, and they will require blood for blood. Oh! my cousin,
whither are you gone?""

He would have rested to restore his mind to its peace, but he could not
sleep; and, without further regard to net or canoe, he set off for the
village, running all the way.

accident has happened.""",217,speed,is a,rate_of_motion,What is speed?,"Speed is the rate of motion, of how fast one moves."

impossible; they were like brothers; they would have fallen for each
other. It can not be.""

At the cousin's request, many of the men visited the fish-fire. There
were no marks of blood. No hasty steps were there to show that any
conflict or struggle had occurred. Every leaf on every tree was in its
place; and they saw, as the cousin had before, that the foot-prints of
Wassamo stopped in the wood, as if he had gone no further upon the
earth, but had ascended into the air.

and sudden vanishing of Wassamo. None ever looked to see him more; only

along the shore of the lake. He looked at the glassy water, and more
than once the thought to end his griefs by casting himself in its
depths, came upon him with such sudden force that it was only by severe
self-control that he was able to turn his steps in another direction. He
reflected--""They will say that I was guilty if I take my own life. No. I
will give them my blood for that of my cousin.""

He walked on, with slow steps, but he found no comfort, turn where he
would; the sweet songs of the grove jarred upon his ear; the beauty of
the blue sky pained his sight; and the soft green earth, as he trode
upon it, seemed harsh to his foot, and sent a pang through every nerve.
""Oh, where is my cousin?"" he kept saying to himself.

Meanwhile, when Wassamo fell senseless before the two young women in the
wood, he lost all knowledge of himself until he wakened in a distant
scene. He heard persons conversing. One spoke in a tone of command,
saying, ""You foolish girls, is this the way that you rove about at

One spoke to him and said: ""Stranger, awake, and take something
wherewith to refresh yourself.""

He obeyed the command and sat up. On either side of the lodge he beheld
rows of people seated in orderly array. At a distance he could see two
stately persons, who looked rather more in years than the others, and
who appeared to exact obedience from all around them. One of them, whom
he heard addressed as the Old Spirit-man, spoke to Wassamo. ""My son,""
said he, ""know it was those foolish girls who brought you hither. They

behold his kindred no more, made him sad.

He was silent, and the Old Spirit continued: ""Your wants will all be
supplied; but you must be careful not to stray far from the lodge. I am
afraid of that Spirit who rules all islands lying in the lakes. He is my
bitter enemy, for I have refused him my daughter in marriage; and when
he learns that you are a member of my family, he will seek to harm you.

her. She shall be your wife.""

Forthwith Wassamo and the Old Spirit's daughter sat near each other in
the lodge, and they were man and wife.

One evening the Old Spirit came in after a busy day's work out among the
sand-hills, in the course of which he had blown them all out of shape
with great gusts of wind, and strewn them about in a thousand
directions, and brought them back and piled them up in all sorts of

None grows about this dry place of mine. You shall return to your
people and procure me a supply. It is seldom that the few who pass these
sand-hills offer me a piece of tobacco,--it is a rare plant in these
parts,--but when they do, it immediately comes to me. Just so,"" he
added, putting his hand out of the side of the lodge and drawing in
several pieces of tobacco which some one passing at that moment offered
as a fee to the Old Spirit, to keep the sand-hills from blowing about
till they had got by.

Other gifts beside tobacco came in the same way to the side of the
lodge--sometimes a whole bear, then a wampum-robe, then a string of
birds--and the Sand-Spirits altogether led an easy life; for they were
not at the trouble to hunt or clothe themselves; and whenever the
housekeeping began to fall short, nothing would happen but a wonderful
storm of dust, all the sand-hills being straightway put in an uproar,

Just then it chanced to thunder again, and Wassamo observed that his
father-in-law made extraordinary dispatch to conceal himself, although
no stranger, at all resembling in any way the Island Spirit, was in
view.

Shortly after this the season of sleep began, and one by one they laid
themselves down to the long slumber.

The Old Spirit was the last to drop away; and, before he yielded, he
went forth and had his last sport with the sand-hills, and he so tossed
and vexed the poor hills, and scattered them to and fro, and whirled
them up in the air, and far over the land, that it was days and days
before they got back to any thing like their natural shape.

himself as best he could. The cupboard never failed him once: for visit

where are you? help this way!"" and the like, which indicated that such
as were journeying through the hills had their own troubles to

time, set out in company with his wife. They traveled on a pleasant
course, his wife leading the way, until they reached a rising ground.

At the highest point of this ground, she said, ""We will soon get to your
country.""

It suddenly became broad day, as they came upon a high bank; they
passed, unwet, for a short distance under the lake, and presently
emerged from the water at the sand-banks, just off the shore where
Wassamo had set his nets on the night when he had been borne away by the
two strange females.

He now left his wife sheltered in a neighboring wood, while he advanced
toward the village alone.

further delay or question, the cousin ran off with breathless dispatch
to the village. He seemed like a shadow upon the open ground, he sped so
fast.

He entered the lodge where sat the mother of Wassamo in mourning for her
son. ""Hear me,"" said the cousin. ""I have seen him whom you accuse me of
having killed. He will be here even while we speak.""

He had scarcely uttered these words when the whole village was astir in
an instant. All ran out and strained their eyes to catch the first view
of him whom they had thought dead. And when Wassamo came forward, they
at first fell from him as though he had been in truth one returned from
the Spirit-land. He entered the lodge of his parents. They saw that it
was Wassamo, living, breathing and as they had ever known him. And joy
lit up the lodge-circle as though a new fire had been kindled in the
eyes of his friends and kinsfolk.",72,shadow,is at location of,ground,Where do we usually see our shadows?,We usually see our shadows on the ground.

the strange land in which he had sojourned during his absence. He added
to his mother, apart from the company, that he was married, and that he
had left his wife at a short distance from the village.

She went out immediately in search of her; they soon found her in the
wood, and all the women in the village conducted her in honor to the
lodge of her new relations. The Indian people were astonished at her
beauty, at the whiteness of her skin, and still more, that she was able
to talk with them in their own language.

The village was happy, and the feast went on as long as the supply held
out. All were delighted to make the acquaintance of the old
Sand-Spirit's daughter; and as they had heard that he was a magician and
guardian of great power, the tobacco which he had sent for by his
son-in-law, came in, in great abundance, with every visitor.

people of his tribe were prosperous with all the country.",183,guardian,is a,person,What is a guardian?,A guardian is a person who guards or protects something or someone.
the-fire-plume,20,"The cousin of Wassamo recovered heart, and sang once more his sad or
mirthful chants, just as the humor was upon him; but he kept close by
Wassamo, and watched him in all his movements. He made it a point to ask
many questions of the country he came from; some of which his cousin
replied to, but others were left entirely in the dark.

At every thunder-storm, as the old Sand-Spirit had foreboded, the wife
of Wassamo disappeared, much to the astonishment of her Indian company,
and, to their greater wonder, she was never idle, night nor day.

When the winter came on, Wassamo prepared for her a comfortable lodge,
to which she withdrew for her long sleep; and he gave notice to his
friends that they must not disturb her, as she would not be with them
again until the spring returned.

Before lying down, she said to her husband, ""No one but yourself must
pass on this side of the lodge.""

The winter passed away with snows, and sports and stones in the lodge;
and when the sap of the maple began to flow, the wife of Wassamo
wakened, and she immediately set about work as before. She helped at
the maple-trees with the others; and, as if luck were in her presence,
the sugar-harvest was greater than had been ever known in all that
region.",15,chant,is a,music,What is a chant?,A chant is a pre-modern music.
the-fire-plume,21,"The gifts of tobacco, after this, came in even more freely than they had
at first; and as each brought his bundle to the lodge of Wassamo, he
asked for the usual length of life, for success as a hunter, and for a
plentiful supply of food. They particularly desired that the sand-hills
might be kept quiet, so that their lands might be moist, and their eyes
clear of dust to sight the game.

Wassamo replied that he would mention each of their requests to his
father-in-law.

The tobacco was stored in sacks, and on the outside of the skins, that
there might be no mistake as to their wants, each one who had given
tobacco had painted and marked in distinct characters the totem or
family emblem of his family and tribe. These the old Sand-Spirit could
read at his leisure, and do what he thought best for each of his various
petitioners.

When the time for his return arrived, Wassamo warned his people that
they should not follow him nor attempt to take note how he disappeared.
He then took the moose-skin sacks filled with tobacco, and bade farewell
to all but Netawis. He insisted on the privilege of attending Wassamo
and his wife for a distance, and when they reached the sand-banks he
expressed the strongest wish to proceed with them on their journey.
Wassamo told him that it could not be; that only spirits could exert the
necessary power, and that there were no such spirits at hand.",89,mention,has subevent,notice,What is mention?,Mention is when you talk about something to get them noticed.
the-fire-plume,22,"They then took an affectionate leave of each other, Wassamo enjoining it
upon his cousin, at risk of his life, to not look back when he had once
started to return.

The cousin, sore at heart, but constrained to obey, parted from them,
and as he walked sadly away, he heard a gliding noise as of the sound of
waters that were cleaved.

He returned home, and told his friends that Wassamo and his wife had
disappeared, but that he knew not how. No one doubted his word in any
thing now.

Wassamo with his wife soon reached their home at the hills. The old
Sand-Spirit was in excellent health, and delighted to see them. He
hailed their return with open arms; and he opened his arms so very wide,
that when he closed them he not only embraced Wassamo and his wife, but
all of the tobacco-sacks which they had brought with them.

The requests of the Indian people were made known to him; he replied
that he would attend to all, but that he must first invite his friends
to smoke with him. Accordingly he at once dispatched his pipe-bearer and
confidential aid to summon various Spirits of his acquaintance, and set
the time for them to come.",45,obey,is the antonym of,rebel,What is the antonym of obey?,Rebel.
the-fire-plume,23,"Meanwhile he had a word of advice for his son-in-law Wassamo. ""My son,""
said he, ""some of these Manitoes that I have asked to come here are of a
very wicked temper, and I warn you especially of that Island Spirit who
wished to marry my daughter. He is a very bad-hearted Monedo, and would
like to do you harm. Some of the company you will, however, find to be
very friendly. A caution for you. When they come in, do you sit close by
your wife; if you do not, you will be lost. She only can save you; for
those who are expected to come are so powerful that they will otherwise
draw you from your seat, and toss you out of the lodge as though you
were a feather. You have only to observe my words and all will be well.""

Wassamo took heed to what the Old Spirit said, and answered that he
would obey.",41,warn,has subevent,advise,What is warn?,Warn is when you advise someone to do or not to do something.
the-fire-plume,24,"About mid-day the company began to assemble; and such a company Wassamo
had never looked on before. There were Spirits from all parts of the
country; such strange-looking persons, and in dresses so wild and
outlandish! One entered who smiled on him. This, Wassamo was informed,
was a Spirit who had charge of the affairs of a tribe in the North, and
he was as pleasant and cheery a Spirit as one would wish to see. Soon
after, Wassamo heard a great rumbling and roaring, as of waters tumbling
over rocks; and presently, with a vast bluster, and fairly shaking the
lodge with his deep-throated hail of welcome to the old Sand-Spirit, in
rolled another, who was the Guardian Spirit and special director of a
great cataract or water-fall not far off.",93,rumble,is a,noise,What is a rumble?,"A rumble is a low, heavy and continuous sound."
the-fire-plume,25,"Then came with crashing steps the owner of several whirlwinds, which
were in the habit of raging about in the neighboring country. And
following this one, glided in a sweet-spoken, gentle-faced little
Spirit, who was understood to represent a summer-gale that was
accustomed to blow, toward evening, in at the lodge-doors, and to be
particularly well disposed toward young lovers.

The last to appear was a great rocky-headed fellow; and he was twice as
stony in his manners; and swaggered and strided in, and raised such a
commotion with his great green blanket when he shook it, that Wassamo
was nearly taken off his feet; and it was only by main force that he was
able to cling by his wife. This, which was the last to enter, was that
wicked Island Spirit, who looked grim enough at Wassamo's wife, who had
rejected him, as he passed in.

Soon after, the old Sand-Spirit, who was a great speech-maker, arose and
addressed the assembly.",92,stride,has subevent,walk,What is stride?,Stride is when one walks with long steps.

desires plainly set forth here,"" laying his hand upon the figured
moose-skins. ""The offering is worthy of our consideration. Brothers, I
see nothing on my part to hinder our granting their requests; they do
not appear to be unreasonable. Brothers, the offer is gratifying. It is
tobacco--an article which we have lacked until we scarcely knew how to
use our pipes. Shall we grant their requests? One thing more I would
say. Brothers, it is this: There is my son-in law; he is mortal. I wish
to detain him with me, and it is with us jointly to make him one of us.""

""Hoke! hoke!"" ran through the whole company of Spirits, and ""Hoke!
hoke!"" they cried again. And it was understood that the petitioners were
to have all they asked, and that Wassamo was thenceforward fairly
accepted as a member of the great family of Spirits.

As a wedding-gift, the Old Spirit asked his son-in-law to make one
request, which should be promptly granted.

""Let there be no sand-squalls among my father's people for three months
to come,"" said Wassamo.

""So shall it be,"" answered the old Sand-Spirit.",220,member,is a,part,What is a member?,A member is part of a group.
the-fire-plume,27,"The tobacco was now divided in equal shares among the company. They
filled their pipes--and huge pipes they were--and such clouds they blew,
that they rushed forth out of the lodge and brought on night, in all
the country round about, several hours before its time.

After a while passed in silence, the Spirits rose up, and bearing off
their tobacco-sacks, they went smoking through the country, and losing
themselves in their own fog, till a late hour in the morning, when all
of their pipes being burned out, each departed on his own business.

The very next day the old Sand-Spirit, who was very much pleased with
the turn affairs had taken at his entertainment, addressed Wassamo:
""Son-in-law, I have made up my mind to allow you another holiday as an
acknowledgment of the handsome manner in which you acquitted yourself of
your embassy. You may visit your parents and relatives once more, to
tell them that their wishes are granted, and to take your leave of them
forever. You can never, after, visit them again.""

Wassamo at once set out, reached his people, and was heartily welcomed.

They asked for his wife, and Wassamo informed them that she had tarried
at home to look after a son, a fine little Sand-Spirit, who had been
born to them since his return.

Having delivered all of his messages and passed a happy time, Wassamo
said, ""I must now bid you all farewell forever.""",185,grant,has subevent,give,What is grant?,Grant is when you give someone something.
the-fire-plume,28,"His parents and friends raised their voices in loud lamentation; they
clung to him, and as a special favor, which he could now grant, being
himself a spirit, he allowed them to accompany him to the sand-banks.

They all seated themselves to watch his last farewell. The day was mild;
the sky clear, not a cloud appearing to dim the heavens, nor a breath of
wind to ruffle the tranquil waters. A perfect silence fell upon the
company. They gazed with eager eyes fastened on Wassamo, as he waded out
into the water, waving his hands. They saw him descend, more and more,
into the depths. They beheld the waves close over his head, and a loud
and piercing wail went up which rent the sky.

They looked again; a red flame, as if the sun had glanced on a billow,
lighted the spot for an instant; but the Feather of Flames, Wassamo of
the Fire-Plume, had disappeared from home and kindred, and the familiar
paths of his youth, forever.",37,accompany,has subevent,travel,What is accompanying someone?,Accompanying someone is traveling with someone.

bring ruin to people everywhere. I have already slain a countless
number of them, and have pretty well done away with them. But this one
is the worst of all. Last night the Lord of the Heavens gave me a

looked up and could see a small, red flame come out of the tree-top.

the-fox-and-the-wolf,1,"There was once a Fox and a Wolf, who set up house together in a cave near the sea-shore. Although you may not think so, they got on very well for a time, for they went out hunting all day, and when they came back
at night they were generally too tired to do anything but to eat their supper and go to bed.

They might have lived together always had it not been for the slyness and greediness of the Fox, who tried to over-reach his companion, who was not nearly so clever as he was.

And this was how it came about.",7,wolf,is at location of,forest,Where do wolves live?,Wolves live in the forest.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,2,"It chanced, one dark December night, that there was a dreadful storm at sea, and in the morning the beach was all strewn with wreckage. So as soon as it was daylight the two friends went down to the shore to see
if they could find anything to eat.

They had the good fortune to light on a great Keg of Butter, which had been washed overboard from some ship on its way home from Ireland, where, as all the world knows, folk are famous for their butter.

The simple Wolf danced with joy when he saw it. ""Marrowbones and trotters! but we will have a good supper this night,"" cried he, licking his lips. ""Let us set to work at once and roll it up to the cave.""",128,lick,has subevent,stroke,What does it mean to lick?,To lick means to stroke with the tongue.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,3,"But the wily Fox was fond of butter, and he made up his mind that he would have it all to himself. So he put on his wisest look, and shook his head gravely.

""You have no prudence, my friend,"" he said reproachfully, ""else would you not talk of breaking up a Keg of Butter at this time of year, when
the stackyards are full of good grain, which can be had for the eating, and the farmyards are stocked with nice fat ducks and poultry. No, no. It behoveth us to have foresight, and to lay up in store for the spring,
when the grain is all threshed, and the stackyards are bare, and the poultry have gone to market. So we will e'en bury the Keg, and dig it up when we have need of it.""

Very reluctantly, for he was thinner and hungrier than the Fox, the Wolf agreed to this proposal. So a hole was dug, and the Keg was buried, and the two animals went off hunting as usual.",98,poultry,is part of,domestic_fowl,What is poultry?,Poultry refers to domestic fowls.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,4,"About a week passed by: then one day the Fox came into the cave, and flung himself down on the ground as if he were very much exhausted. But if anyone had looked at him closely they would have seen a sly twinkle
in his eye.

""Oh, dear, oh, dear!"" he sighed. ""Life is a heavy burden.""

""What have befallen you?"" asked the Wolf, who was ever kind and
soft-hearted.

""Some friends of mine, who live over the hills yonder, are wanting me to go to a christening to-night. Just think of the distance that I must
travel.""

""But do you need to go?"" asked the Wolf. ""Can you not send an excuse?""

""I doubt that no excuse would be accepted,"" answered the Fox, ""for they asked me to stand god-father. Therefore it behoveth me to do my duty,
and pay no heed to my own feelings.""",2,week,is a,time_period,What is a week?,A week is a time period equals to seven days.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,5,"So that evening the Fox was absent, and the Wolf was alone in the cave. But it was not to a christening that the sly Fox went; it was to the Keg of Butter that was buried in the sand. About midnight he returned, looking fat and sleek, and well pleased with himself.

The Wolf had been dozing, but he looked up drowsily as his companion entered. ""Well, how did they name the bairn?"" he asked.

""They gave it a queer name,"" answered the Fox. ""One of the queerest
names that I ever heard.""

""And what was that?"" questioned the Wolf.

""Nothing less than 'Blaisean' (Let-me-taste),"" replied the Fox, throwing himself down in his corner. And if the Wolf could have seen him in the darkness he would have noticed that he was laughing to himself.",84,bairn,is a,child,What is a bairn?,A bairn is a child or baby.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,6,"Some days afterwards the same thing happened. The Fox was asked to another christening; this time at a place some twenty-five miles along the shore. And as he had grumbled before, so he grumbled again; but he declared that it was his duty to go, and he went.

At midnight he came back, smiling to himself and with no appetite for his supper. And when the Wolf asked him the name of the child, he answered that it was a more extraordinary name than the other--""Be na Inheadnon"" (Be in its middle).

The very next week, much to the Wolf's wonder, the Fox was asked to yet another christening. And this time the name of the child was ""Sgriot an Clar"" (Scrape the staves). After that the invitations ceased.",42,declare,has subevent,proclaim,What does it mean to declare?,To declare means to proclaim.

""Let us go and dig up the Keg of Butter,"" said the Wolf. ""Methinks that now is the time we need it.""

The Fox agreed--having made up his mind how he would act--and the two set out to the place where the Keg had been hidden. They scraped away the sand, and uncovered it; but, needless to say, they found it empty.",87,keg,is a,barrel,What is a keg?,A keg is a small barrel often used to store beer.

""Not I,"" replied the Wolf. ""I have never been near the spot since the
day that we buried it together.""

""But I tell you it must have been you,"" insisted the Fox, ""for no
other creature knew it was there except ourselves. And, besides, I can see by the sleekness of your fur that you have fared well of late.""",17,innocent,is the antonym of,guilty,What is the opposite of innocent?,Guilty.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,9,"Which last sentence was both unjust and untrue, for the poor Wolf looked as lean and badly nourished as he could possibly be.

So back they both went to the cave, arguing all the way. The Fox
declaring that the Wolf  must have been the thief, and the Wolf
protesting his innocence.

""Are you ready to swear to it?"" said the Fox at last; though why he
asked such a question, dear only knows.

""Yes, I am,"" replied the Wolf firmly; and, standing in the middle of
the cave, and holding one paw up solemnly he swore this awful oath:

    ""If it be that I stole the butter; if it be, if it be--
    May a fateful, fell disease fall on me, fall on me.""",128,butter,is a,dairy_product,What is butter?,Butter is a dairy product.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,10,"When he was finished, he put down his paw and, turning to the Fox,
looked at him keenly; for all at once it struck him that his fur looked
sleek and fine.

""It is your turn now,"" he said. ""I have sworn, and you must do so also.""

The Fox's face fell at these words, for although he was both untruthful and dishonest now, he had been well brought up in his youth, and he knew that it was a terrible thing to perjure oneself and swear falsely.",100,perjure,has subevent,swear,What does it mean to perjure?,To perjure means to swear falsely.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,11,"So he made one excuse after another, but the Wolf, who was getting more and more suspicious every moment, would not listen to him.

So, as he had not courage to tell the truth, he was forced at last to
swear an oath also, and this was what he swore:

    ""If it be that I stole the butter; if it be, if it be--
    Then let some most deadly punishment fall on me, fall on me--
    Whirrum wheeckam, whirrum wheeckam,
    Whirram whee, whirram whee!""",81,punishment,is the antonym of,reward,What is the opposite of punishment?,Reward.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,12,"After he had heard him swear this terrible oath, the Wolf thought that his suspicions must be groundless, and he would have let the matter rest; but the Fox, having an uneasy conscience, could not do so. So he suggested that as it was clear that one of them must have eaten the Keg of Butter, they should both stand near the fire; so that when they became hot, the butter would ooze out of the skin of whichever of them was guilty. And he took care that the Wolf should stand in the hottest place.

But the fire was big and the cave was small; and while the poor lean
Wolf showed no sign of discomfort, he himself, being nice and fat and comfortable, soon began to get unpleasantly warm.

As this did not suit him at all, he next proposed that they should go
for a walk, ""for,"" said he, ""it is now quite plain that neither of us
can have taken the butter. It must have been some stranger who hath found out our secret.""",45,suggest,has subevent,imply,What does it mean to suggest?,To suggest means to imply without explicitly stating something.
the-fox-and-the-wolf,13,"But the Wolf had seen the Fox beginning to grow greasy, and he knew now what had happened, and he determined to have his revenge. So he waited until they came to a smithy which stood at the side of the road, where a horse was waiting just outside the door to be shod.

Then, keeping at a safe distance, he said to his companion, ""There is
writing on that smithy door, which I cannot read, as my eyes are
failing; do thou try to read it, for perchance it may be something
it were good for us to know.""

And the silly Fox, who was very vain, and did not like to confess that
his eyes were no better than those of his friend, went close up to the
door to try and read the writing. And he chanced to touch the horse's
fetlock, and, it being a restive beast, lifted its foot and struck out
at once, and killed the Fox as dead as a door-nail.

And so, you see, the old saying in the Good Book came true after all:

them, could find out what was the matter with him, or even give him

roads met. He did not know which to choose, and tossed his cap in the
air, determining that the direction of its fall should decide him.
After travelling for two or three days, he grew tired of walking without
knowing where or for how long, and he stopped at an inn which was filled
with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink.

to seek the Golden Blackbird. The youth took the same direction as his
brother, and when he came to the cross roads, he too tossed up which
road he should take. The cap fell in the same place as before, and he
walked on till he came to the spot where his brother had halted. The
latter, who was leaning out of the window of the inn, called to him to
stay where he was and amuse himself.

'You are right,' replied the youth. 'Who knows if I should ever find the
Golden Blackbird, even if I sought the whole world through for it. At

where his brothers were still prisoners. They called to him to stop, and
did all they could to prevent his going further.

'No,' he replied, 'my father trusted me, and I will go all over the

cannot be cured unless I bring him back the Golden Blackbird. It is a
long time since I set out, but no one can tell me where to find it.'

'Ah,' said the hare, 'you have a long way to go yet. You will have to
walk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it.'

and it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large and
beautiful as a castle could be.

'The Golden Blackbird is in a little cabin near by,' said the little
hare, 'and you will easily find it. It lives in a little cage, with
another cage beside it made all of gold. But whatever you do, be sure
not to put it in the beautiful cage, or everybody in the castle will
know that you have stolen it.'

The youth found the Golden Blackbird standing on a wooden perch, but as
stiff and rigid as if he was dead. And beside the beautiful cage was the
cage of gold.

'No,' he answered, 'I am not a thief. If I have taken the Golden
Blackbird, it is only that it may cure my father, who is ill, and I have
travelled more than seven hundred miles in order to find it.'

the-golden-blackbird,8,"The youth departed, weeping, and met the little hare, who was munching

'What are you crying for, my friend?' asked the hare.

'It is because,' he answered, 'the castle people will not allow me to
carry off the Golden Blackbird without giving them the Porcelain Maiden
in exchange.'

'You have not followed my advice,' said the little hare. 'And you have
put the Golden Bird into the fine cage.'

bathe with her friends, while I just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh
me. When she is in the lake, be sure you hide her clothes, which are of
dazzling whiteness, and do not give them back to her unless she consents
to follow you.'

weeping bitterly.

her clothes, the young man bought a small horse for her, which went like

Blackbird, and when they drew near to the castle where it lived the
little hero said to the young man:

'Now, do be a little sharper than you were before, and you will manage
to carry off both the Golden Blackbird and the Porcelain Maiden. Take

is, and bring that away too.'",101,hand,is part of,arm,What is hand?, The part of the forelimb below the arm.

castle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the Golden Bird.

them by paying their debt. They set out all together, but as the two
elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngest, they took
the opportunity as they were passing by the shores of a lake to throw
themselves upon him, seize the Golden Bird, and fling him in the water.
Then they continued their journey, taking with them the Porcelain
Maiden, in the firm belief that their brother was drowned. But, happily,
he had snatched in falling at a tuft of rushes and called loudly for
help. The little hare came running to him, and said 'Take hold of my leg

place as stable-boy, and go and offer your services to your father. Once
there, you will easily be able to make him understand the truth.'

The young man did as the little hare bade him, and he went to his
father's castle and enquired if they were not in want of a stable-boy.

'Yes,' replied his father, 'very much indeed. But it is not an easy
place. There is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyone
go near it, and it has already kicked to death several people who have
tried to groom it.'

'I will undertake to groom it,' said the youth. 'I never saw the horse
I was afraid of yet.' The little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down
without a toss of its head and without a kick.

broke forth into a joyful song, and the Porcelain Maiden sang too, and
jumped for joy.

Blackbird know you too?'

disguised myself and came here, in order to prove the truth to you.'

When he had brought the precious robes, the Crab put on the golden garment and then crept upon the golden cushion, and in this way the fisherman carried him to the castle, where the Crab presented the other garment to his bride. Now the ceremony took place, and when the married pair were alone together the Crab made himself known to his young wife, and told her how he was the son of the greatest king in the world, and how he was enchanted, so that he became a crab by day and was a man only at night; and he could also change himself into an eagle as often as he wished. No sooner had he said this than he shook himself, and immediately became a handsome youth, but the next morning he was forced to creep back again into his crab-shell. And the same thing happened every day. But the Princess's affection for the Crab, and the polite attention with which she behaved to him, surprised the royal family very much. They suspected some secret, but though they spied and spied, they could not discover it. Thus a year passed away, and the Princess had a son, whom she called Benjamin. But her mother still thought the whole matter very strange. At last she said to the King that he ought to ask his daughter whether she would not like to have another husband instead of the Crab? But when the daughter was questioned she only answered:

'I am married to the Crab, and him only will I have.'",203,secret,is a,information,What is a secret?,A secret is a piece of imformation kept unknown to others.

In the evening the Princess told this to the Crab, who said to her, 'Take this rod, go to the garden gate and knock with it, then a black man will come out and say to you, ' 'Why have you called me, and what do you require of me?' Answer him thus: 'Your master the King has sent me hither to tell you to send him his golden armour and his steed and the silver apple.' ' And bring them to me.'

For if you do this evil will come of it. Place yourself at the window with your sisters; I will ride by and throw you the silver apple. Take it in your hand, but if they ask you who I am, say that you do not know.' So saying, he kissed her, repeated his warning once more, and went away.

The Princess went with her sisters to the window and looked on at the tournament. Presently her husband rode by and threw the apple up to her. She caught it in her hand and went with it to her room, and by-and-by her husband came back to her. But her father was much surprised that she did not seem to care about any of the Princes; he therefore appointed a second tournament.

The Crab then gave his wife the same directions as before, only this time the apple which she received from the black man was of gold.

In the evening, while the Princess, with her mother and sisters, was standing at the window, the Prince suddenly galloped past on his steed and threw her the golden apple.

Then her mother flew into a passion, gave her a box on the ear, and cried out, 'Does not even that prince please you, you fool?'

The Princess in her fright exclaimed, 'That is the Crab himself!'

Her mother was still more angry because she had not been told sooner, ran into her daughter's room where the crab-shell was still lying, took it up and threw it into the fire.

The old man ran after him, but the dog reached a door, pushed it open, and ran in, the old man following him. He did not overtake the dog, but found himself above a staircase, which he descended. Then he saw before him a stately palace, and, entering, he found in a large hall a table set for twelve persons. He hid himself in the hall behind a great picture, that he might see what would happen. At noon he heard a great noise, so that he trembled with fear. When he took courage to look out from behind the picture, he saw twelve eagles flying in. At this sight his fear became still greater.

Then the old man went away too, returned to the light of day, and went home. Soon after he heard that the Princess was ill, and that the only thing that did her good was having stories told to her. He therefore went to the royal castle, obtained an audience of the Princess, and told her about the strange things he had seen in the underground palace.

The youths seated themselves at the table; and now the Prince said again, while he took up the cup of wine:

Jack was passing through a wood, and being weary, sat down and went to

husbands had been killed by the giants, who had then condemned them to
be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own
dead husbands.

""Ladies,"" said Jack, ""I have put an end to the monster and his wicked

forth a Welsh giant. Jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way,
on which the giant made him welcome, and let him into a room where there
was a good bed to sleep in.

Jack took off his clothes quickly, but though he was weary he could not
go to sleep. Soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and

groped about the room, and at last found a large thick billet of wood.
He laid it in his own place in the bed, and then hid himself in a dark
corner of the room.

himself, so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat, and
slip the hasty-pudding into this bag, while he seemed to put it into his
mouth.

When breakfast was over he said to the giant: ""Now I will show you a
fine trick. I can cure all wounds with a touch; I could cut off my head

came in sight of another giant, who was sitting on a block of timber
waiting for his brother's return.

till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a
lonely house, when an old man let him in.

with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the giant, and the magician was

Then the voice from the iron stove said, 'I will help you to find your home again, and that in a very short time, if you will promise to do what I ask you. I am a greater prince than you are a princess, and I will marry you.' Then she grew frightened, and thought, 'What can a young lassie do with an iron stove?'

I should never have come home again out of the great wild wood if I had not come to an iron stove, to whom I have had to promise that I will go back to free him and marry him!' The old King was so frightened that he nearly fainted, for she was his only daughter. So they consulted together, and determined that the miller's daughter, who was very beautiful, should take her place. They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she must scrape at the iron stove. She scraped for twenty-four hours, but did not make the least impression. When the day broke, a voice called from the iron stove, 'It seems to me that it is day outside.' Then she answered, 'It seems so to me; I think I hear my father's mill rattling.'

Then she was taken out, and had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours, but she could make no impression. As soon as the day broke the voice from the stove called out, 'It seems to be daylight outside.' Then she answered, 'It seems so to me too; I think I hear my father blowing his horn.' 'So you are a swineherd's daughter! Go away at once, and let the King's daughter come.

Then she peeped in and saw such a beautiful youth all shining with gold and precious stones that she fell in love with him on the spot.

But the Prince was free, and was no longer shut up in it. Then she said good-bye to her father, and took a little money with her, and went again into the great wood to look for the iron stove; but she could not find it.

She thought, 'Alas! what am I coming to?' and peeped through the window; but she saw nothing inside except big and little toads, and a table beautifully spread with roast meats and wine, and all the dishes and drinking-cups were of silver. Then she took heart and knocked. Then a fat toad called out:

She would have need of them, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, three cutting swords, and a great lake. When she had passed these she would find her lover again. So she was given three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts, which she was to take great care of.

Though it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took the false bride's clothes away, so that she could not follow them. When they came to the great lake they rowed across, and when they reached the three sharp swords they sat on the plough-wheel, and on the glassy mountain they stuck the three needles in. So they arrived at last at the little old house, but when they stepped inside it turned into a large castle. The toads were all freed, and were beautiful King's children, running about for joy. There they were married, and they remained in the castle, which was much larger than that of the Princess's father's. But because the old man did not like being left alone, they went and fetched him.

the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,1,"In a little lodge at a beautiful spot on a lake shore, alone with his
sister, lived a boy remarkable for the smallness of his stature. Many
large rocks were scattered around their habitation, and it had a very
wild and out-of-the-way look.

The boy grew no larger as he advanced in years. Yet, small as he
was, he had a big spirit of his own, and loved dearly to play the master
in the lodge. One day in winter he told his sister to make him a ball to
play with. He meant to have some sport along the shore on the clear
ice. When she handed him the ball, his sister cautioned him not to go
too far.

He laughed at her, and ran off in high glee, throwing his ball before
him and running after it at full speed. He went as fast as his ball.

could. After he had run forward for some time, he saw what seemed four

men, lying on the ice, spearing fish. They were four brothers, who
looked exactly alike. As the little boy-man approached them, the nearest
looked up. In his turn he was surprised to see such a tiny being.
Turning to his brothers, he said:

""Tia! look! see what a little fellow is here.""

The three others then looked up too. Seeing these four faces,
as if they had been one, the little spirit or boy-man said to himself:

""Four in one! What a time they must have in choosing their
hunting-shirts!""

After they had all stared for a moment at the boy, they covered their
heads, intent in searching for fish. The boy thought to himself:

""These four-faces fancy that I am to be put off without notice because I
am so little. They are so broad and long. They shall find out. I may
find a way to teach them that I am not to be treated so lightly.""",195,teach,is a,communicate_knowledge_or_skill,How to teach?,By communicating knowledge or skills.

among them they had caught one large trout, which was lying just by
their side. Stealing along, he slyly seized it. Placing his fingers
in the gills, and tossing his ball before him, he ran off at full speed.

They heard the pattering of his little steps upon the ice. When the
four looked up all together, they saw their fine trout sliding away, as
if of itself, at a great rate, the boy being so small that he could not
be distinguished from the fish.

""See!"" they cried out, ""our fish is running away on the dry land!""

When they stood up they could just see, over the fish's head, that it
was the boy-man who was carrying it off.

The little spirit reached the lodge, and having left the trout at the
door, he told his sister to go out and bring in the fish he had brought
home.

She exclaimed, ""Where could you have got it? I hope you have not stolen
it.""",37,seize,has subevent,take,What is seize?,To deliberately take hold of.

that come out of its waters.""

""How,"" the sister asked again, ""could you have got it there?""

""No matter,"" said the boy; ""go and cook it.""

It was as much as the girl could do to drag the great trout within
doors. She cooked it, and its flavor was so delicious that she asked no
more questions as to how he had come by it.

The next morning the little spirit or boy-man set off as he had the day
before.

He made all sorts of sport with his ball as he frolicked along. High
over his head he would toss it, straight up into the air; then far
before him. And again, in mere merriment of spirit, he would send it
bounding back, as if he had plenty of speed and enough to spare in
running back after it. The ball leaped and bounded about, and glided
through the air as if it were a live thing, and enjoyed the sport as
much as the boy-man himself.",105,flavor,is a,sensory_information,What sensory information can we get when eating?,Flavor.
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,5,"When he came within hail of the four large men, who were fishing there
every day, he cast his ball with such force that it rolled into the
ice-hole about which they were busy. The boy, standing on the shore of
the lake, called out:

""Four-in-one, pray hand me my ball.""

""No, indeed,"" they answered, setting up a grim laugh which curdled their
four dark faces all at once, ""we shall not."" With their
fishing-spears they thrust the ball under the ice.

""Good!"" said the boy-man, ""we shall see.""

Saying which he rushed upon the four brothers and thrust them at one
push into the water. His ball bounded back to the surface, and, picking
it up, he ran off, tossing it before him in his own sportive way.
Outstripping it in speed he soon reached home, and remained within till
the next morning.

The four brothers, rising up from the water at the same time, dripping
and angry, roared out in one voice a terrible threat of vengeance, which
they promised to execute the next day. They knew the boy's speed, and
that they could by no means overtake him.

By times in the morning, the four brothers were stirring in their lodge,
and getting ready to look after their revenge.

as he does.""

But her sons paid no heed to this wise advice. Raising a great
war-cry, which frightened the birds overhead nearly out of their
feathers, they started for the boy's lodge among the rocks.

The little spirit or boy-man heard them roaring forth their threats as
they approached, but he did not appear to be disquieted in the least.
His sister as yet had heard nothing. After a while she thought she could
distinguish the noise of snow-shoes on the snow, at a distance, but
rapidly advancing. She looked out, and seeing the four large men coming
straight to their lodge she was in great fear, and running in,
exclaimed:

She then gave little spirit his dish, and he commenced eating.

Just then the brothers came to the door.

""See!"" cried the sister, ""the man with four heads!""

The brothers were about to lift the curtain at the door, when the
boy-man turned his dish upside down. Immediately the door was closed
with a stone, upon which the four brothers set to work and hammered with
their clubs with great fury. At length they succeeded in making a
slight opening. One of the brothers presented his face at this little
window, and rolled his eye about at the boy-man in a very threatening
way.

The little spirit, who, when he had closed the door, had returned to his
meal, which he was quietly eating, took up his bow and arrow which lay
by his side, He let fly the shaft, which, striking the man in the head,
he fell back. The boy-man merely called out ""Number one"" as he fell, and
went on with his meal.",134,succeed,has subevent,work_hard,What is necessary to succeeding?,Working hard.

""What is the use? You have killed that man already.""

Little spirit fired his arrow--the man fell--he called out ""Number two,""
and continued his meal.

The two others of the four brothers were dispatched in the same quiet
way, and counted off as ""Number three"" and ""Number four.""

After they were all well disposed of in this way, the boy-man directed
his sister to go out and see them. She presently ran back, saying:

""There are four of them.""

""Of course,"" the boy-man answered, ""and there always shall be four of
them.""

Going out himself, the boy-man raised the brothers to their feet, and
giving each a push, one with his face to the East, another to the West,
a third to the South, and the last to the North, he sent them off to
wander about the earth. Whenever you see four men just alike, they
are the four brothers whom the little spirit or boy-man dispatched upon
their travels.

But this was not the last display of the boy-man's power.

When spring came on, and the lake began to sparkle in the morning sun,
the boy-man said to his sister:

""Make me a new set of arrows, and a bow.""",138,answer,is the antonym of,question,What is a response or reply to a question?,Answer.

performed household or hard work of any kind, and his sister obeyed.

When she had made the weapons, which, though they were very small, were
beautifully wrought and of the best stuff the field and wood could
furnish, she again cautioned him not to shoot into the lake.

""She thinks,"" said the boy-man to himself, ""I can see no further into
the water than she. My sister shall learn better.""

Regardless of her warnings, he on purpose discharged a shaft into the
lake. He waded out into the water till he got into its depth, and paddled
about for his arrow, so as to call the attention of his sister, and as
if to show that he hardily braved her advice.

She hurried to the shore, calling on him to return. But instead of
heeding her, he cried out:

""You of the red fins, come and swallow me!""

Although his sister did not clearly understand whom her brother was
addressing, she too called out:

""Don't mind the foolish boy!""

The boy-man's order seemed to be best attended to, for immediately a
monstrous fish came and swallowed him. Before disappearing entirely,
catching a glimpse of his sister standing in despair upon the shore, the
boy-man hallooed out to her:

""Me-zush-ke-zin-ance!""

She wondered what he meant. At last it occurred to her that it must be
an old moccasin. She accordingly ran to the lodge, and bringing one, she

""Go, take hold of it, swallow it as fast as you can. It is a great
delicacy.""

The fish darted toward the old shoe and swallowed it, making of it a
mere mouthful.

The boy-man laughed in himself, but said nothing, till the fish was
fairly caught, when he took hold of the line and began to pull himself
in his fish-carriage ashore.

The sister, who was watching all this time, opened wide her eyes as the
huge fish came up and up upon the shore. She opened them still more
when the fish seemed to speak. She heard from within a voice,
saying, ""Make haste and release me from this nasty place.""

It was her brother's voice, which she was accustomed to obey. She
made haste with her knife to open a door in the side of the fish, from
which the boy-man presently leaped forth. He lost no time in ordering

greater than the rest of the world.

They sat, one evening, in the lodge, musing with each other in the dark,
by the light of each other's eyes--for they had no other of any
kind--when the sister said, ""My brother, it is strange that you, who can
do so much, are no wiser than the Ko-ko, who gets all his light from the
moon; which shines or not, as it pleases.""

""And is not that light enough?"" asked the little spirit.

""Quite enough,"" the sister replied. ""If it would but come within the
lodge and not sojourn out in the tree-tops and among the clouds.""

As the boy-man chanted this call, they came in at first one by one, then
in couples, till at last, swarming in little armies, the fire-flies lit
up the little lodge with a thousand sparkling lamps, just as the stars
were lighting the mighty hollow of the sky without.

Then little Bessie Bostwick came to the counter to buy a hair ribbon and laid her parcels beside the box. When she went away she gathered up the box with her other bundles and trotted off home with it.

Bessie never knew, until after she had hung her coat in the hall closet and counted up her parcels, that she had one too many. Then she opened it and exclaimed:

""Why, it's a box of candy! Someone must have mislaid it. But it is too small a matter to worry about; there are only a few pieces.""

The little girl had, with infinite pains, contrived to learn two ""pieces"" which she usually executed with a jerky movement of her right hand and a left hand that forgot to keep up and so made dreadful discords.

Meanwhile Bessie played one piece after another with untiring energy. She loved music, and now found that all she need do was to sit at the piano and listen and watch her hands twinkle over the keyboard.

The professor was watching him, so Mr. Bostwick courteously held the dish toward him. The professor ate the lemon-yellow piece and the senator reached out his hand and took the lavender piece. He did not eat it, however, for, chancing to remember that it might spoil his dinner, he put it in his vest pocket.

That night he sat up late writing a political speech he was to deliver the next afternoon at Faneuil hall, but his experiences at the Bostwicks' had so unnerved him that he could scarcely collect his thoughts, and often he would pause and shake his head pityingly as he remembered the strange things he had seen in that usually respectable home.",57,parlor,is used for,entertaining_guests,What is a parlor?,A parlor is a room for entertaining guests.

So the big hall was crowded with people, and in one of the front rows sat the Bostwick family, with the learned Yale professor beside them.

was weary with the day's hunt, which had carried him far away.

arose, and peeping through the door of the lodge, beheld her greedily

the mirror had magic powers, so that he who owned it had but to ask and
his wish would be fulfilled; to it Insato owed all that he possessed.

As soon as the king left him, Gopani-Kufa again took Zengi-mizi, out of
his basket.  'Zengi-mizi,' he said, 'the king seems loth to grant my
request for the Mirror--is there not some other thing of equal value
for which I might ask?'

And the wasp answered: 'There is nothing in the world, O Gopani-Kufa,
which is of such value as this Mirror, for it is a Wishing Mirror, and
accomplishes the desires of him who owns it.  If the king hesitates, go
to him the next day, and the day after, and in the end he will bestow
the Mirror upon you, for you saved his life.'",25,own,causes,buy,What can you do if you want to own something in a shop?,I can buy it if I want to own it.

him the Mirror, which was of polished iron, saying: 'Take Sipao, then,
O Gopani- Kufa, and may thy wishes come true.  Go back now to thine own
country; Sipao will show you the way.'

Gopani-Kufa was greatly rejoiced, and, taking farewell of the king,
said to the Mirror:

'Sipao, Sipao, I wish to be back upon the Earth again!'

Instantly he found himself standing upon the upper earth; but, not
knowing the spot, he said again to the Mirror:

for they thought that he had been eaten by lions; but he comforted
them, saying that while following a wounded antelope he had missed his
way and had wandered for a long time before he had found the path again.

That night he asked Zengi-mizi, in whom sat the spirit of his father,
what he had better ask Sipao for next?

'Biz-z-z,' said the wasp, 'would you not like to be as great a chief as
Insato?'

were walking, and young boys were driving out the sheep and cattle to

astonished at all these wonders to ask any questions, but his daughter
Shasasa kept begging him to tell her how he had suddenly become so
great; so at last he revealed the whole secret, and even entrusted
Sipao the Mirror to her care, saying:

after that for many years Gopani-Kufa ruled his people both well and
wisely, so that all men loved him, and never once did he need to ask
Sipao to grant him a wish.

Now it happened that, after many years, when the hair of Gopani-Kufa
was turning grey with age, there came white men to that country.  Up
the Zambesi they came, and they fought long and fiercely with
Gopani-Kufa; but, because of the power of the Magic Mirror, he beat
them, and they fled to the sea-coast.  Chief among them was one Rei, a
man of much cunning, who sought to discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's
power.  So one day he called to him a trusty servant named Butou, and
said: 'Go you to the town and find out for me what is the secret of its
greatness.'",110,flee,has subevent,run,What does it mean by fleeing somewhere?,Fleeing somewhere means running away from somewhere.

himself, and said: 'O Chief! take pity on me, for I have no home!  When
Rei marched against you I alone stood apart, for I knew that all the
strength of the Zambesi lay in your hands, and because I would not
fight against you he turned me forth into the forest to starve!'

feasted him, and gave him a house.",72,apart,is the antonym of,together,What is the antonym of apart?,Together.

the secret of the Magic Mirror.  One night, when all the town slept, he
felt beneath her pillow and, finding the Mirror, he stole it and fled
back with it to Rei, the chief of the white men.

So it befell that, one day, as Gopani-Kufa was gazing up at the river
from a window of the palace he again saw the war-canoes of the white
men; and at the sight his spirit misgave him.

'Shasasa! my daughter!' he cried wildly, 'go fetch me the mirror, for
the white men are at hand.'

'O Gopani-Kufa!' hummed the wasp, 'there is nothing now that can be
done, for the words of the antelope which you slew are being fulfilled.'

'Alas!  I am an old man--I had forgotten!' cried the chief.  'The words
of the antelope were true words--my reward shall be my undoing--they
are being fulfilled!'

Then the white men fell upon the people of Gopani-Kufa and slew them

the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,1,"As a punishment for having once upon a time used that foot against a
venerable medicine man, Aggo Dah Gauda had one leg looped up to his
thigh, so that he was obliged to get along by hopping. By dint of
practice he had become very skillful in this exercise, and he could make
leaps which seemed almost incredible.

Aggo had a beautiful daughter, and his chief care was to secure her from
being carried off by the king of the buffalos, who was the ruler of all
the herds of that kind, and had them entirely at his command to make
them do as he willed.

Dah Gauda, too, was quite an important person in his own way, for he
lived in great state, having a log house of his own, and a court-yard
which extended from the sill of his front-door as many hundred miles
westward as he chose to measure it.

Although he might claim this extensive privilege of ground, he advised
his daughter to keep within doors, and by no means to go far in the
neighborhood, as she would otherwise be sure to be stolen away, as he
was satisfied that the buffalo-king spent night and day lurking about
and lying in wait to seize her.",182,daughter,is the antonym of,mother,What is opposite to daughters?,Mothers.

before he left the lodge he reminded her of her strange and industrious
lover, whom she had never seen.

""My daughter,"" said he, ""I am going out to fish, and as the day will be
a pleasant one, you must recollect that we have an enemy near, who is
constantly going about with two eyes that never close, and do not expose
yourself out of the lodge.""

With this excellent advice, Aggo hopped off in high spirits; but he had
scarcely reached the fishing-ground when he heard a voice singing, at a
distance:

    Man with the leg tied up,

        Broken hip--hip--

as he suspected the ditty to be the work of his enemies, the buffalos,
he hopped home as fast as his one leg could carry him.

Meantime, the daughter had no sooner been left alone in the lodge than
she thought with herself:

""It is hard to be thus forever kept in doors. But my father says it
would be dangerous to venture abroad. I know what I will do. I will get
on the top of the house, and there I can comb and dress my hair, and no
one can harm me.""

She accordingly ascended the roof and busied herself in untying and
combing her beautiful hair; for it was truly beautiful, not only of a
fine, glossy quality, but it was so very long that it hung over the
eaves of the house and reached down on the ground, as she sat dressing
it.",143,beautiful,is the antonym of,ugly,What is opposite to beautiful?,Ugly.

when, all of a sudden, the king of the buffalos came dashing on with his
herd of followers, and making sure of her by means of her drooping
tresses, he placed her upon the back of one of his favorite buffalos,
and away he cantered over the plains. Plunging into a river that bounded
his land, he bore her safely to his lodge on the other side.

And now the buffalo-king having secured the beautiful person of Aggo Dah
Gauda's daughter, he set to work to make her heart his own--a little
ceremony which it would have been, perhaps, wiser for his majesty, the
king of the buffalos, to have attended to before, for he now worked to
little purpose. Although he labored with great zeal to gain her
affections, she sat pensive and disconsolate in the lodge, among the
other females, and scarcely ever spoke, nor did she take the least
interest in the affairs of the king's household.

To the king himself she paid no heed, and although he breathed forth to
her every soft and gentle word he could think of, she sat still and
motionless for all the world like one of the lowly bushes by the door of

wanted, and to be careful not to displease her. They set before her the
choicest food. They gave her the seat of honor in the lodge. The king
himself went out hunting to obtain the most dainty meats, both of
animals and wild fowl, to pleasure her palate; and he treated her every
morning to a ride upon one of the royal buffalos, who was so gentle in
his motions as not even to disturb a single one of the tresses of the
beautiful hair of Aggo's daughter as she paced along.

And not content with these proofs of his attachment, the king would
sometimes fast from all food, and having thus purified his spirit and
cleared his voice, he would take his Indian flute, and, sitting before

daughter had been stolen, his indignation was so thoroughly awakened
that he would have forthwith torn every hair from his head, but, being
entirely bald, this was out of the question, so, as an easy and natural
vent to his feelings, Aggo hopped off half a mile in every direction.
First he hopped east, then he hopped west, next he hopped north, and
again he hopped south, all in search of his daughter; till the one leg
was fairly tired out. Then he sat down in his lodge, and resting himself
a little, he reflected, and then he vowed that his single leg should
never know rest again until he had found his beautiful daughter and
brought her home. For this purpose he immediately set out.

Now that he proceeded more coolly, he could easily track the
buffalo-king until he came to the banks of the river, where he saw that
he had plunged in and swam over. There having been a frosty night or two
since, the water was so covered with thin ice that Aggo could not
venture upon it, even with one leg. He encamped hard by till it became

hair was all untied when she was caught up, and being very long it took
hold of the branches as they darted along, and it was these twigs that
she broke off as signs to her father.

When Aggo came to the king's lodge it was evening. Carefully
approaching, he peeped through the sides, and saw his daughter sitting
disconsolate. She immediately caught his eye, and knowing that it was
her father come for her, she all at once appeared to relent in her
heart, and, asking for the royal dipper, said to the king, ""I will go
and get you a drink of water.""

waited with impatience for her return.",116,eye,is capable of,sense_light,What can eyes do?,They can sense light.

plains, and had not gone far when they espied by the light of the moon,
which was shining roundly just over the edge of the prairie, Aggo Dah
Gauda, his daughter in his arms, making all speed with his one leg
toward the west.

The buffalos being set on by their king, raised a great shout, and
scampered off in pursuit. They thought to overtake Aggo in less than no
time; but although he had a single leg only, it was in such fine
condition to go, that to every pace of theirs, he hopped the length of a
cedar-tree.

But the buffalo-king was well assured that he would be able to overtake
Aggo, hop as briskly as he might. It would be a mortal shame, thought
the king, to be outstripped by a man with one leg tied up; so, shouting
and cheering, and issuing orders on all sides, he set the swiftest of
his herd upon the track, with strict commands to take Aggo dead or
alive. And a curious sight it was to see.",152,able,is the antonym of,unable,What is opposite to able?,Unable.

the point of laying hold of him, when off Aggo would hop, a good
furlong, in an oblique line, wide out of his reach; which bringing
him nearly in contact with another of the herd, away he would go again,
just as far off in another direction.

And in this way Aggo kept the whole company of the buffalos zig-zagging
across the plain, with the poor king at their head, running to and fro,
shouting among them and hurrying them about in the wildest way. It was
an extraordinary road that Aggo was taking toward home; and after a time
it so puzzled and bewildered the buffalos that they were driven half out
of their wits, and they roared, and brandished their tails, and foamed,
as if they would put out of countenance and frighten out of sight the
old man in the moon, who was looking on all the time, just above the
edge of the prairie.

of chasing a man with one leg all night long, he called his herd

young warrior, who was neither a buffalo-king nor so much as the owner

Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one. He needed it, as it was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors was covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.

There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and plantains. There stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every flower had its name.

There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots.

""Thou canst not do anything against me!"" said Death.
""But OUR LORD can!"" said she.
""I only do His bidding!"" said Death. ""I am His gardener, I take all His flowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise, in the unknown land; but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare not tell thee.""
""Give me back my child!"" said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand, and cried out to Death, ""I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in despair.""
""Touch them not!"" said Death. ""Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy, and now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy.""",118,garden,is used for,growing_flowers,What do we usually do with a garden?,We grow flowers in a garden.

And she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see how the one became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy were felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow and distress, horror, and wretchedness.

indeed she was too frightened to move. In another minute the snake had
reached her side, and to her surprise he spoke.

save you from rain,' and she opened the pot, and when the snake had
slipped in, she put on the cover. Soon she beheld another snake coming
after the other one, and when it had reached her it stopped and said,

is to secure through life a guardian genius or spirit. The father was
ambitious that his son should surpass all others in whatever was deemed
wisest and greatest among his people. To accomplish his wish, he thought
it necessary that the young Iadilla should fast a much longer time than
any of those renowned for their power or wisdom, whose fame he coveted.

He therefore directed his son to prepare with great ceremony for the
important event. After he had been several times in the sweating-lodge
and bath, which were to prepare and purify him for communion with his
good spirit, he ordered him to lie down upon a clean mat in a little
lodge expressly provided for him. He enjoined upon him at the same time

The father addressed Iadilla as he had the day before, and promised that
he would himself prepare his first meal, and bring it to him by the dawn
of the morning.

The son moaned, and the father added:

""Will you bring shame upon your father when his sun is falling in the
west?""

""I will not shame you, my father,"" replied Iadilla; and he lay so still
and motionless that you could only know that he was living by the gentle
heaving of his breast.",213,gentle,is the antonym of,harsh,What is the antonym of gentle?,Harsh.
the-origin-of-the-robin,4,"At the spring of day, the next morning, the father, delighted at having
gained his end, prepared a repast for his son, and hastened to set it
before him. On coming to the door of the little lodge, he was surprised
to hear his son talking to himself. He stooped his ear to listen, and,
looking through a small opening, he was yet more astonished when he
beheld his son painted with vermilion over all his breast, and in the
act of finishing his work by laying on the paint as far back on his
shoulders as he could reach with his hands, saying at the same time, to
himself:

""My father has destroyed my fortune as a man. He would not listen to my
requests. He has urged me beyond my tender strength. He will be the
loser. I shall be forever happy in my new state, for I have been
obedient to my parent. He alone will be the sufferer, for my guardian
spirit is a just one. Though not propitious to me in the manner I
desired, he has shown me pity in another way--he has given me another
shape; and now I must go.""",187,guardian,is a,person,What is a guardian?,A guardian is a person who guards and protects.

""My son! my son! I pray you leave me not!""

But the young man, with the quickness of a bird, had flown to the top of
the lodge and perched himself on the highest pole, having been changed
into a beautiful robin red-breast. He looked down upon his father with
pity beaming in his eyes, and addressed him as follows:",19,pray,has subevent,speak_to_god,Who do you usually talk to when you are praying?,I speak to God.

contented; and although I could not gratify your wishes as a warrior, it
will be my daily aim to make you amends for it as a harbinger of peace
and joy. I will cheer you by my songs, and strive to inspire in others
the joy and lightsomeness of heart I feel in my present state. This will
be some compensation to you for the loss of glory you expected. I am now
free from the cares and pains of human life. My food is spontaneously
furnished by the mountains and fields, and my pathway of life is in the

""I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,"" wrote Duchess; and then at
the end she added--""I hope it isn't mouse?""

out ""isn't mouse"" and changed it to ""I hope it will be fine,"" and she
gave her letter to the postman.",67,duchess,is a,noblewoman,What is a duchess?,"A duchess is a nobleman, the wife of a duke."

because it is a party. And MY pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink
and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were
both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.""

Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at
it.

""It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put
in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the

was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the
oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and
handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie
into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.

""The top oven bakes too quickly,"" said Ribby to herself. ""It is a pie of
the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have
taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a
fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast--rather big
mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior

Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as
well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put
them straight; the hearth-rug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock
and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the
tables and chairs.

Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best

comfortable.

Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to
the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a
pot of marmalade.

And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other
end of the village.

Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out,
after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.

Cousin Tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation--

""A little DOG indeed! Just as if there were no CATS in Sawrey! And a PIE
for afternoon tea! The very idea!"" said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.

Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins. Then she went
home.",99,muffin,is a,quick_bread,What is a muffin?,A muffin is a quick bread.

was coming in at the front door.

""I trust that is not that Pie: the spoons are locked up, however,"" said
Ribby.

But there was nobody there. Ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty, and turned the pie. There began to be a pleasing smell of
baked mouse!

Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.

""It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put
mine in! And I can t find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house.
I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of
the other handles; I think that they are all shams,"" said Duchess, ""but

picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and
passed the time until the clock struck four.

Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no
one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her
dress.

She put on a lilac silk gown, for the party, and an embroidered muslin
apron and tippet.

""It is very strange,"" said Ribby, ""I did not THINK I left that drawer
pulled out; has somebody been trying on my mittens?""

She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the
hob. She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely
brown, and it was steaming hot.

She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. ""I am glad I
used the BOTTOM oven,"" said Ribby, ""the top one would certainly have
been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can
there really have been some one in the house?""",115,mitten,is a,glove,What is a mitten?,A mitten is a glove.

ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to
wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby's house.

""I wonder if Ribby has taken MY pie out of the oven yet?"" said Duchess,
""and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse?""

At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little
tap-tappity. ""Is Mrs. Ribston at home?"" inquired Duchess in the porch.

""Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?"" cried Ribby. ""I hope I
see you well?""

""Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?"" said
Duchess. ""I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!""

""Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!""

""Do not talk about food, my dear Ribby,"" said Duchess; ""what a lovely
white tea-cloth!.... Is it done to a turn? Is it still in the oven?""

""I think it wants another five minutes,"" said Ribby. ""Just a shade
longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my
dear Duchess?""

sweetly pretty!""",189,bacon,is made of,pig,What is bacon made of?,Bacon is made of pork from pigs.

and bacon----""

She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the
tea-table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out
the pie.

Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.

Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up
on a chair.

""I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and
marmalade,"" said Ribby.

""Do you really prefer muffin? Mind the patty-pan!""

""I beg your pardon?"" said Ribby.

""I think""--(thought the Duchess to herself)--""I THINK it would be wiser
if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything
when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into!
I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a
quicker oven than my own.""

""How fast Duchess is eating!"" thought Ribby to herself, as she buttered
her fifth muffin.

The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four helps already,
and was fumbling with the spoon.

""A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?"" said Ribby.

""Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan.""

""The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?""

""The patty-pan that held up the pie-crust,"" said Duchess, blushing under
her black coat.

""Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,"" said Ribby; ""I don't think
that it is necessary in pies made of mouse.""

Duchess fumbled with the spoon--""I can't find it!"" she said anxiously.

""There isn't a patty-pan,"" said Ribby, looking perplexed.

""Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?"" said Duchess.

metal in MY puddings or pies.""
Duchess looked aghast, and tilted up the pie-dish.
""I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.""
Duchess set up a howl.
""I shall die! I shall die! I have swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear
Ribby, I do feel so ill!""

Duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about.

He was occupied in putting rusty nails into a bottle of ink, which he
had obtained at the post office.

""Gammon? ha! HA!"" said he, with his head on one side.

Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.

""Spinach? ha! HA!"" said he, and accompanied her with alacrity.

She got up and went to the table, and felt inside the pie-dish again
with a spoon.

""No; there is no patty-pan, and I put one in; and nobody has eaten pie

through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a

Duchess drew a long breath--

""Then I must have been eating MOUSE!... NO wonder I feel ill.... But

in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round
to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.

Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws. The
jackdaws were eating pie-crust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of

sky is obscured, and the seas are shrouded in profound darkness. And
often, in the distance, one may see a bright opening in the darkness.
If the ship holds a course straight for this opening it will win
through, and is suddenly floating in calm waters again. Looking back,
one may see the two fishes still spouting water, and the ship will
have passed directly beneath their jaws. But a storm is always near
when the fish dragons swim; therefore it is well to burn paper or wool
so that the dragons do not draw the ship down into the depths. Or the
Master of the Wand may burn incense before the wand in the cabin. Then
he must take the wand and swing it over the water three times, in a
circle. If he does so the dragons will draw in their tails and
disappear.",9,picture,is a,representation,What do we use pictures to do?,To do representations.

climbed well in their short dresses, and soon they were deep in the
wood.

There were plenty of bilberries and elder berries, but no raspberries.
They wandered on and on, and at last they came... No, it could not be
true!... they came to a large raspberry wood. The wood had been on fire
once, and now raspberry bushes had grown up, and there were raspberry

it was cool and dusky in the great wood.

The girls became anxious but went steadily on, expecting that the wood
would soon end, and that they would see the smoke from the chimneys of
their home.

After they had wandered on for a long time it began to grow dark. At
last they reached a great plain overgrown with bushes, and when they
looked around them, they saw, as much as they could in the darkness,

time Lisa said: 'How very queer! I have a sandwich in my hand.'

appetite. When they had finished Aina yawned, stretched out her arms and
said: 'Oh, if only we had a nice soft bed to sleep on now!'

Scarcely had she spoken before she felt a nice soft bed by her side, and

At first the girls were filled with wonder when they saw that they had
slept in the wood among the raspberry bushes. They looked at each other,
they looked at their beds, which were of the finest flax covered over
with leaves and moss. At last Lisa said: 'Are you awake, Aina?'

'Yes,' said Aina.

'But I am still dreaming,' said Lisa.

sugar, and tasted it; never in their lives had they drunk such beautiful

man, in a white coat and a red cap, limping out from among the bushes,
for he was lame in his left foot; neither Lisa nor Aina could utter a
word, they were so filled with surprise.

'Don't be afraid, little girls,' he said smiling kindly at them; he
could not laugh properly because his mouth was crooked. 'Welcome to my
kingdom! Have you slept well and eaten well and drunk well?' he asked.

the woods, and the sea, and the sky, did not want me to become proud of
my royal power and my long life. Therefore he decreed that one day in
every hundred years I should change into a little raspberry worm, and
live in that weak and helpless form from sunrise to sunset. During that
time my life is dependent on the little worm's life, so that a bird can
eat me, a child can pick me with the berries and trample under foot my
thousand years of life. Now yesterday was just my transformation day,
and I was taken with the raspberry and would have been trampled to death
if you had not saved my life. Until sunset I lay helpless in the grass,
and when I was swept away from your table I twisted one of my feet, and
my mouth became crooked with terror; but when evening came and I could
take my own form again, I looked for you to thank you and reward you.
Then I found you both here in my kingdom, and tried to meet you both as
well as I could without frightening you. Now I will send a bird from my
wood to show you the way home. Good-bye, little children, thank you
for your kind hearts; the raspberry king can show that he is not
ungrateful.'",116,dependent,is the antonym of,independent,What is the antonym of dependent?,Independent.

from me, too. Good-bye.'

through the wood after the bird; and soon it began to get lighter in the

had been looking for them, and the big sister had not been able to
sleep, for she thought the wolves had eaten them up.

Otto met them; he had a basket in his hand and said: 'Look, here is
something that an old man has just left for you.'

When the girls looked into the basket they saw a pair of most beautiful
bracelets of precious stones, dark red, and made in the shape of a ripe
raspberry and with an inscription: 'To Lisa and Aina'; beside them there
was a diamond breast pin in the shape of a raspberry worm: on it was
inscribed 'Otto, never destroy the helpless!'",85,bracelet,is at location of,jewelry_store,Where can we usually see many bracelets?,At the jewelry store.

The raspberry king had also remembered the big sister, for when she went
in to set the table for dinner, she found eleven big baskets of most
beautiful raspberries, and no one knew how they had come there, but
everyone guessed.

the-red-swan,1,"Three brothers were left destitute, by the death of their parents, at an
early age. The eldest was not yet able to provide fully for their
support, but he did all that he could in hunting. With this aid, and
the stock of provisions already laid by in the lodge, they managed to
keep along. They had no neighbors to lend them a helping hand, for the
father had withdrawn many years before from the body of the tribe, and
had lived ever since in a solitary place. The lads had no idea that
there was a human being near them. They did not even know who their
parents had been. At the time of their death, the eldest was too
young to remember it.

Forlorn as they were, they however kept a good heart, and making use of
every chance, in course of time they all acquired a knowledge of hunting
and the pursuit of game. The eldest became expert in the craft of the
forest, and he was very successful in procuring food. He was noted for
his skill in killing buffalo, elk, and moose. He instructed his
brothers, so that each should become a master over a particular animal
which was assigned to him.",179,expert,is a,person,What is an expert?,An expert is a person with extraordinary capability.

elder proposed to leave them and to go in search of the world, promising
to return as soon as he could procure them wives. In this intention he
was overruled by his brothers, who said that they could not part with
him.

Jeekewis, the second, was loud in disapproval of the scheme, saying:
""What will you do with those you propose to get? We have lived so long
by ourselves, we can still do without them."" This counsel prevailed, and
for a time the three brothers continued together.

One day they agreed to kill each a male of that kind of animal, which
each was most expert in hunting, for the purpose of making quivers from
their skins. When these quivers were prepared, they were straightway
filled, with arrows. They all had a presentiment that something was
about to happen which called upon them to be ready.",146,quiver,is a,case,What is a quiver?,A quiver is a case or container for arrows.

game, and have the privilege of acting as entertainer to the others.
They were to shoot no other beast or bird than such as each was in the
habit of killing.

They set out on different paths. Maidwa, the youngest, had not gone far
before he saw a bear, an animal he was not to kill, by the agreement.
He, however, followed him closely, and driving an arrow through and
through him, he brought him to the ground.

Although contrary to the engagement with his brothers, Maidwa commenced
skinning him, when suddenly something red tinged the air all around him.
He rubbed his eyes, thinking he was perhaps deceived. But rub as hard as
he would, the red hue still crimsoned the air, and tinged every object
that he looked on--the tree-tops, the river that flowed, and the deer
that glided away along the edge of the forest--with its delicate
splendor.",141,deceive,has subevent,misinform,What does it mean to be deceived?,It means to be fooled or misinformed.
the-red-swan,4,"As he stood musing on this fairy spectacle, a strange noise came to his
ear from a distance. At first it seemed like a human voice. After
following the sound he reached the shore of a lake. Floating at a
distance upon its waters sat a most beautiful Red Swan, whose plumage
glittered in the sun, and when it lifted up its neck, it uttered the
peculiar tone he had heard. He was within long bow-shot, and, drawing
the arrow to his ear, he took a careful aim and discharged the shaft. It
took no effect. The beautiful bird sat proudly on the water, still
pouring forth its peculiar chant, and still spreading the radiance of
its plumage far and wide, and lighting up the whole world, beneath the
eye of Maidwa, with its ruby splendors.

He shot again and again, till his quiver was empty, for he longed to
possess so glorious a creature. Still the swan did not spread its wings
to fly, but, circling round and round, stretched its long neck and
dipped its bill into the water, as if indifferent to mortal shafts.

Maidwa ran home, and bringing all the arrows in the lodge, shot them
away. He then stood with his bow dropped at his side, lost in wonder,
gazing at the beautiful bird.",122,peculiar,is the antonym of,common,What is the opposite of peculiar?,Common.
the-red-swan,5,"While standing thus, with a heart beating more and more eagerly every
moment for the possession of this fair swan, Maidwa remembered the
saying of his elder brother, that in their deceased father's
medicine-sack were three magic arrows. His brother had not told
Maidwa that their father, on his death-bed, which he alone had attended,
had especially bequeathed the arrows to his youngest son, Maidwa, from
whom they had been wrongfully kept. The thought of the magic arrows put
heart in Maidwa, and he hastened with all speed to secure them.

At any other time he would have shrunk from opening his father's
medicine-sack, but something prompted him to believe that there was no
wrong now. Snatching them forth he ran back, not staying to restore
the other contents to the sack, but leaving them scattered, here and
there, about the lodge.

He feared, as he returned, that the swan must by this time have taken
wing. But, as he emerged from the wood, to his great delight the air was
as rosy as ever, and there, in her own serene and beautiful way, still
sat the glorious Red Swan.

With trembling hand he shot the first of his magic shafts: it grazed a
wing. The second came closer, and cut away a few of the bright red
feathers, which fluttered and fell like flakes of fire in the water. The
third, which he carefully aimed and drew home upon the string with all
his force, made the lucky hit, and passed through the neck of the bird a
little above the breast.",64,bequeath,has subevent,give,What does it meam to bequeath?,To bequeath means to give or leave by will.
the-red-swan,6,"""The bird is mine,"" said Maidwa, to himself. But to his great surprise,
instead of seeing it droop its neck and drift to the shore, the Red Swan
flapped its wings, rose slowly, and flew off with a majestic motion
toward the falling sun.

Maidwa, that he might meet his brothers, rescued two of the magic arrows
from the water; and although the third was borne off, he had a hope yet
to recover that too, and to be master of the swan. He was noted for his
speed; for he would shoot an arrow and then run so fast that the arrow
always fell behind him; and he now set off at his best speed of foot. ""I
can run fast,"" he thought, ""and I can get up with the swan some time or
other.""

He sped on, over hills and prairies, toward the west, and was only
going to take one more run, and then seek a place to sleep for the
night, when, suddenly, he heard noises at a distance, like the murmur of
waters against the shore. As he went on, he heard voices, and presently
he saw people, some of whom were busy felling trees, and the strokes of
their labor echoed through the woods. He passed on, and when he emerged
from the forest, the sun was just falling below the edge of the sky.",169,prairie,is a,grassland,What is a prairie?,A prairie is a broad area of grassland.
the-red-swan,7,"He was bent on success in pursuit of the swan, whose red track he marked
well far westward till she was lost to sight. Meanwhile he would tarry
for the night and procure something to eat, as he had fasted since he
had left home.

At a distance, on a rising ground, he could see the lodges of a large
village. He went toward it, and soon heard the watchman, who was set on
a height to overlook the place, and give notice of the approach of
friends or foes, crying out, ""We are visited;"" and a loud halloo
indicated that they had all heard it.

When Maidwa advanced, the watchman pointed to the lodge of the chief.
""It is there you must go in,"" he said, and left him.

""Come in, come in,"" said the chief; ""take a seat there;"" pointing to the
side of the lodge where his daughter sat. ""It is there you must sit.""

They gave him something to eat, and, being a stranger, very few
questions were put to him. It was only when he spoke that the others
answered him.

""Daughter,"" said the chief, as soon as the night had set in, ""take our
son-in-law's moccasins and see if they be torn. If so, mend them for
him, and bring in his bundle.""",248,moccasin,is a,casual_shoe,What is a moccasin?,A moccassin is a traditional casual shoe in North America.
the-red-swan,8,"Maidwa thought it strange that he should be so warmly received, and
married instantly against his own wishes, although he could not help
noticing that the chief's daughter was pretty.

It was some time before she would take the moccasins which he had laid
off. It displeased him to see her reluctant to do so. When at last she
did reach them, he snatched them from her hand and hung them up himself.
He lay down and thought of the swan, and made up his mind to be off with
the dawn. He wakened early, and finding the chief's daughter looking
forth at the door, he spoke to her, but she gave no answer. He touched
her lightly.

""What do you want?"" she said, and turned her face away from him.

""Tell me,"" said Maidwa, ""what time the swan passed. I am following it;
come out, and point the way.""

""Do you think you can overtake it?"" she said.

""Yes,"" he answered.

""Naubesah--fool!"" retorted the chief's pretty daughter.

She, however, went out, and pointed in the direction he should go. The
young man paced slowly along till the sun arose, when he commenced
traveling at his accustomed speed. He passed the day in running, and
although he could not see anywhere on the horizon the Red Swan, he
thought that he discerned a faint red light far over in the west.",88,swan,is a,aquatic_bird,What is a swan?,A swan is a graceful aquatic bird.
the-red-swan,9,"When night came, he was pleased to find himself near another village.
When at a distance he heard the watchman crying out, ""We are
visited!"" and soon the men of the village stood out to see the stranger.

He was again told to enter the lodge of the chief, and his reception was
in every respect the same as on the previous night. Except that the
young woman was more beautiful, and that she entertained him very
kindly. Although urged to stay with them, the mind of Maidwa was fixed
on the object of his journey.

Before daybreak he asked the young woman at what time the Red Swan
passed, and to point out the way. She marked against the sky with her
finger the course it had taken, and told him that it had passed
yesterday when the sun was between mid-day and its falling-place.

Maidwa again set out rather slowly, but when the sun had risen, he tried
his speed by shooting an arrow ahead, and running after it. But it fell
behind him, and he knew that he had lost nothing of his quickness of
foot.

Nothing remarkable happened through the day, and he went on leisurely.
Some time after dark, as he was peering around the country for a
shelter, he saw a light emitted from a small low lodge. He went up to it
very slyly, and, peeping through the door, he discovered an old man
alone, with his head down upon his breast, warming his back before the
fire.",12,village,is a,settlement,What is a village?,A village is a rural settlement relatively small in size.
the-red-swan,10,"Maidwa thought that the old man did not know that he was standing near
the door. In this he was mistaken. Without turning his eyes to
look at him, the old man said, ""Walk in, my grandchild. Take a seat
opposite to me, and take off your things and dry them, for you must be
fatigued. I will prepare you something to eat, and you shall have
something very delicate.""

Maidwa accepted this kind invitation, and entered the lodge. The old man
then remarked, as if in mere course of conversation: ""My kettle with
water stands near the fire."" Immediately a small earthen pot with
legs appeared by the fire. He then took one grain of corn, also one of
whortleberry, and put them in the pot.

Maidwa was very hungry, and seeing the limited scale of the old man's
housekeeping, he thought his chance for a supper was very slight. The
old man had promised him something very delicate, and he seemed likely
to keep his word. Maidwa looked on silently, and did not change his face
any more than if the greatest banquet that was ever spread had been
going forward.

The pot soon boiled, when the old man said in a very quiet way:

""The pot will stand at a distance from the fire.""",214,banquet,is a,meal,What is a banquet?,A banquet is a large celebratory meal.
the-red-swan,11,"It removed itself, and the old man added to Maidwa:

""My grandchild, feed yourself;"" handing him at the same time a dish and
ladle of the same ware as the pot itself.

The young man, whose hunger was very great, helped himself to all that
was in the pot. He felt ashamed to think that he had done so, but before
he could speak the old man said:

""Eat, nay grandchild. Eat, eat!"" and soon after he again said--""Help
yourself from the pot.""

Maidwa was surprised, on dipping in his ladle, to see that it was full.
Although he emptied it a second time, it was still again filled and
refilled till his hunger was entirely satisfied. The old man then
observed, without raising his voice:

""The pot will return to its corner;"" and the pot took itself off to its
accustomed place in an out-of-the-way corner of the lodge.

Maidwa observed that the old man was about to address him, and took an
attitude which showed that he was prepared to listen.",168,pot,is used for,make_soup,What do we use to make soup?,We use pots to make soup.
the-red-swan,12,"""Keep on, my grandchild,"" said the old man. ""You will surely gain that
you seek. To tell you more I am not permitted, but go on as you have
begun and you will not be disappointed. To-morrow you will again reach
one of my fellow old men, but the one you will see after him will tell
you all, and the manner in which you must proceed to accomplish your
journey. Often has this Red Swan passed, and those who have followed it
have never returned. You must be firm in your resolution, and be
prepared for all that may happen.""

""So will it be,"" answered Maidwa; and they both laid down to sleep.

Early in the morning the old man ordered his magic kettle to prepare
breakfast, so that his guest might eat before leaving. As Maidwa passed
out, the old man gave him a blessing with his parting advice.

Maidwa set forth in better spirits than at any time since he had
started. Night again found him in company with an old man who
entertained him kindly, with a frisky little kettle which hurried up to
the fire before it was spoken to, bustled about and set his supper
briskly before Maidwa, and frisked away again, without waiting for
orders. The old man also carefully directed him on his way in the
morning.",146,kettle,is used for,boil_water,What do we use kettles for?,We use kettles to boil water.
the-red-swan,13,"He traveled with a light heart, as he now expected to meet the one who
was to give him directions how to proceed to get the Red Swan.

Toward night-fall Maidwa reached the lodge of the third old man. Before
coming to the door he heard him saying:

""Grandchild, come in;"" and going in promptly he felt quite at home.

The old man prepared him something to eat, acting as the other magicians
had done, and his kettle was of the same size, and looked as if it were
an own brother of the two others which had feasted him. Except that this
kettle, in coming and going about its household duties, would make a
passing remark, or sing a little tune for itself.

The old man waited until Maidwa had fully satisfied his hunger, when he
addressed him:",125,duty,is a,work,What is duty?,Duty is the work that one is obligated to do.
the-red-swan,14,"Young man, the errand you are bound on is beset with trials and
difficulties. Numbers have passed with the same purpose as that which
now prompts you, but they never returned. Be careful, and if your
guardian spirits are powerful you may succeed. This Red Swan you are
following is the daughter of a magician who has abundance of every
thing, but only this one child, whom he values more than the sacred
arrows. In former times he wore a cap of wampum, which was attached to
his scalp. But powerful Indians, warriors of a distant chief, came and
told him that their chief's daughter was on the brink of the grave, and
that she herself requested his wampum-cap, which she was confident would
save her life. 'If I can only see it,' she said, 'I will recover.' It
was for this cap they had come, and after long solicitation the magician
at length consented to part with it, in the hope that it would restore
to health the dying maiden, although when he took it off to hand it to
the messengers it left the crown of his head bare and bloody. Years have
passed since, and it has not healed. The coming of the warriors to
procure it for the sick maiden was a cheat, and they are now constantly
making sport of the unhappy scalp--dancing it about from village to
village--and on every insult it receives the poor old chief to whom it
belongs groans with pain.",91,wampum,is a,beads,What is a wampum?,A wampum is a small bead made from polished shells.
the-red-swan,15,"Those who hold it are too powerful for the
magician, and many have sacrificed themselves to recover it for him, but
without success. The Red Swan has enticed many a young man, as she has
you, to enlist them to procure the scalp, and whoever is so fortunate as
to succeed, it is understood, will receive the Red Swan as his reward.
In the morning you will proceed on your way, and toward evening you will
come to this magician's lodge. You will know it by the groans which you
will hear far over the prairie as you approach. He will ask you in. You
will see no one but himself. He will question you much as to your dreams
and the strength of your guardian spirits. If he is satisfied with your
answers, he will urge you to attempt the recovery of his scalp. He will
show you the course to take, and if you feel inclined, as I see that
you do, go forward, my son, with a strong heart; persevere, and I have a
presentiment that you will succeed.",161,scalp,is a,skin,What is scalp?,Scalp is the skin at the top of the head.
the-red-swan,16,"Maidwa answered, ""I will try.""

Betimes in the morning, after having eaten from the magic kettle, which
sung a sort of farewell chant on its way from the fire-place to its
station in the corner, he set off on his journey.

Toward evening, Maidwa, as he crossed a prairie, heard, as had been
predicted, groans from a distant lodge, which were only interrupted by a
voice from a person whom he could not see, calling to him aloud:

""Come in! come in!""

On entering the lodge, the magician heaved a great groan from the very
bottom of his chest, and Maidwa saw that the crown of his head was all
bare and bloody.

""Sit down, sit down,"" he said, ""while I prepare you something to eat.
You see how poor I am. I have to attend to all my own wants, with no
other servant than that poor little kettle in the corner. Kettle, we
will have something to eat, if you please.""

""In a moment,"" the kettle spoke up from the corner.

""You will oblige me by making all the dispatch you can,"" said the
magician, in a very humble tone, still addressing the kettle.

""Have patience,"" replied the kettle, ""and I will be with you presently.""

After a considerable delay, there came forward out of the corner from
which it had spoken, a great heavy-browed and pot-bodied kettle, which
advanced with much stateliness and solemnity of manner till it had come
directly in front of the magician, whom it addressed with the question:

""What shall we have, sir?""

""Corn, if you please,"" the magician answered.

""No, we will have whortleberries,"" rejoined the kettle, in a firm voice.

""Very well; just as you choose.""

When he supposed it was time, the magician invited Maidwa to help
himself.",150,prepare,has subevent,make,What does it mean to prepare?,To prepare means to make someone ready for something.
the-red-swan,17,"""Hold a minute,"" interposed the kettle, as Maidwa was about to dip in
his ladle. He paused, and after a delay, the kettle, shaking itself up
and simmering very loudly, said, ""Now we are ready.""

Maidwa fell to and satisfied his hunger.

""Will the kettle now withdraw?"" asked the magician, with am air of much
deference.

""No,"" said the kettle, ""we will stay and hear what the young man has to
say for himself.""

""Very well,"" said the magician. ""You see,"" he added to Maidwa, ""how poor
I am. I have to take counsel with the kettle, or I should be all alone,
without a day's food, and with no one to advise me.""

All this time the Red Swan was carefully concealed in the lodge, behind
a curtain, from which Maidwa heard now and then a rustling noise, that
fluttered his spirits and set his heart to beating at a wonderful rate.

As soon as Maidwa had partaken of food and laid aside his leggings and
moccasins, the old magician commenced telling him how he had lost his
scalp, the insults it was receiving, the pain he suffered thereby, his
wishes to regain it, the many unsuccessful attempts that had already
been made, and the numbers and power of those who retained it. He would
interrupt his discourse, at times, with sudden groans, and say:

""Oh, how shamefully they are treating it.""

Maidwa listened to all the old magician had to say with solemn
attention.

The magician renewed his discourse, and inquired of Maidwa as to his
dreams, or what he saw in his sleep, at such times as he had fasted and
darkened his face to procure guardian spirits.

Maidwa then told him one dream. The magician groaned.

""No, that is not it,"" he said.",343,procure,has subevent,obtain,What does it mean to procure?,To procure means to obtain.
the-red-swan,18,"Maidwa told him of two or three others.

The magician groaned again and again, and said, rather peevishly, ""No,
these are not the dreams.""

""Keep cool,"" said the kettle, which had left the fire, and was standing
in the middle of the floor, where a pleasant breeze was blowing through
the lodge, and added, ""Have you no more dreams of another kind?""

""Yes,"" said Maidwa; and he told him one.

""That will do,"" said the kettle. ""We are much pleased with that.""

""Yes, that is it--that is it!"" the magician added. ""You will cause me to
live. That was what I was wishing you to say. Will you then go and see
if you can not recover my poor scalp?""

""Yes,"" said Maidwa, ""I will go; and the day after to-morrow, when you
hear the ka-kak cries of the hawk, you will know that I am successful.
You must prepare your head, and lean it out through the door, so that
the moment I arrive I may place your scalp on.""

""Yes, yes,"" said the magician. ""As you say it will be done.""

Early the next morning Maidwa set out to fulfill his promise; and in the
afternoon, when the sun hangs toward home, he heard the shouts of a
great many people. He was in a wood at the time, and saw, as he thought,
only a few men, but as he went on they increased in numbers. On emerging
upon the plain, their heads appeared like the hanging leaves, they were
so many.",60,breeze,is a,wind,What is a breeze?,A breeze is a gentle wind.
the-red-swan,19,"In the middle of the plain he perceived a post, and something waving at
its top. It was the wampum scalp; and every now and then the air was
rent with the war-song, for they were dancing the war-dance in high
spirit around it.

Before he could be observed, Maidwa changed himself into a humming-bird,
and flew toward the scalp. As he passed some of those who were standing
by, he came close to their ears, and as they heard the rapid whirr or
murmur which this bird makes when it flies, they jumped aside, and asked
each other what it could be. Maidwa had nearly reached the scalp, but
fearing that he should be perceived while untying it, he again changed
himself into the down that floats lightly on the air, and sailed slowly
on to the scalp. He loosened it, and moved off heavily, as the weight
was almost too great for him to bear up. The Indians around would have
snatched it away had not a lucky current of air just then buoyed him up.
As they saw that it was moving away they cried out, ""It is taken from
us! it is taken from us!""",53,observe,has subevent,watch,What does it mean to observe?,To observe means to watch carefully.
the-red-swan,20,"Maidwa was borne gently along but a little way above their heads; and as
they followed him, the rush and hum of the people was like the dead
beating of the surges upon a lake shore after a storm. But the good wind
gaining strength, soon carried him beyond their pursuit. A little
further on he changed himself into a hawk, and flew swiftly off with
his trophy, crying, ""Ka-kak! ka-kak!"" till it resounded with its shrill
tone through the whole country, far and wide.

Meanwhile the magician had remembered the instructions of Maidwa,
placing his head outside of the lodge as soon as he heard the ka-kak cry
of the hawk.

In a moment Maidwa came past with rustling wings, and as he flew by,
giving the magician a severe blow on the head with the wampum scalp, his
limbs extended and quivered in an agony, the scalp adhered, and Maidwa,
in his own person, walked into the lodge and sat down, feeling perfectly
at home.

The magician was so long in recovering from the stunning blow which had
been dealt him, that Maidwa feared that in restoring the crown of his
head he had destroyed his life. Presently, however, he was pleased to
see him show, by the motion of his hands and limbs, that his strength
was returning; and in a little while he rose and stood upon his feet.
What was the delight of Maidwa to behold, instead of a withered old man,
far advanced in years and stricken in sorrow, a bright and cheerful
youth, who glittered with life as he stood up before him.",33,surge,is a,increase,What is a surge?,A surge is a sudden increase.
the-red-swan,21,"""Thank you, my friend,"" he said. ""Your kindness and bravery of heart
have restored me to my former shape. It was so ordained, and you have
now accomplished the victory.""

They embraced; and the young magician urged the stay of his deliverer
for a few days, and they formed a strong attachment to each other. The
magician, to the deep regret of Maidwa, never once alluded to the Red
Swan in all their conferences.

At last the day arrived when Maidwa prepared to return to his home. The
young magician bestowed on him ample presents of wampum, fur, robes, and
other costly things. Although Maidwa's heart was burning within him to
see the Red Swan, to hear her spoken of, and to learn what his fortune
was to be in regard to that fond object of his pursuit, he constrained
his feelings, and so checked his countenance as to never look where he
supposed she might be. His friend the young magician observed the same
silence and caution.",13,kindness,is a,human_virtue,What is kindness?,Kindness is a part of human virtue.
the-red-swan,22,"Maidwa's pack for traveling was now ready, and he was taking his
farewell smoke, when the young magician thus addressed him: ""My friend
Maidwa, you know for what cause you came thus far, and why you have
risked so much and waited so long. You have proved my friend indeed. You
have accomplished your object, and your noble perseverance shall not go
unrewarded. If you undertake other things with the same spirit, you will
always succeed. My destiny compels me to remain where I am, although I
should feel happy to be allowed to go with you. I have given you, of
ordinary gifts, all you will need as long as you live; but I see you
are backward to speak of the Red Swan. I vowed that whoever procured me
my lost wampum-scalp should be rewarded by possessing the Red Swan.""

He then spoke in a language which Maidwa did not understand, the curtain
of the lodge parted, and the Red Swan met his gaze. It was a beautiful
female that he beheld, so majestical and airy in her look, that he
seemed to see a creature whose home should rather be in the free heaven,
and among the rosy clouds, than in this dusky lodge.

""Take her,"" the young magician said; ""she is my sister; treat her well.
She is worthy of you, and what you have done for me merits more. She is
ready to go with you to your kindred and friends, and has been so ever
since your arrival; and my good wishes shall go with you both.""

The Red Swan smiled kindly on Maidwa, who advanced and greeted her. Hand
in hand they took their way forth from the lodge, and, watched by the
young magician, advanced across the prairie on their homeward course.",292,arrival,is the antonym of,departure,What is the opposite of arrival?,Departure.
the-red-swan,23,"They traveled slowly, and looked with double joy on the beautiful
country over which they had both so lately passed with hearts ill at
ease.

After two or three days they reached the lodge of the third old man who
had entertained him with the singing kettle; but the kettle was not
there. The old man, nevertheless, received them very kindly, and said
to Maidwa, ""You see what your perseverance has secured you; do so
always, and you will succeed in whatever you undertake.""

On the following morning, when they were about to start, he pulled from
the side of the lodge a bag, which he presented to Maidwa, saying,
""Grandchild, I give you this; it contains a present for you; and I hope
you will live happily till old age.""

Bidding him farewell, they again set forward; and they soon came to the
second old man's lodge; he also gave them a present and bestowed his
blessing. Nor did Maidwa see any thing here of the frisky little kettle
which had been so lively on his former visit.",80,secure,has subevent,guarantee,What do we mean when we say someone is secured?,We mean that someone's safety is guaranteed.
the-red-swan,24,"As they went on and came to the lodge of the first old man, their
reception and farewell were the same; and when Maidwa glanced to the
corner, the silent kettle, which had been the first acquaintance he had
made in that family on his travels, was not there. The old man smiled
when he discovered the direction of Maidwa's glance, but he said
nothing.

When, on continuing their journey, they at last approached the first
town which Maidwa had passed in his pursuit, the watchman gave notice as
before, and he was shown into the chief's lodge.

""Sit down there, son-in-law,"" said the chief, pointing to a place near
his daughter. ""And you also,"" he said to the Red Swan.

The chief's daughter was engaged in coloring a girdle, and, as if
indifferent to these visitors, she did not even raise her head.
Presently the chief said, ""Let some one bring in the bundle of our
son-in-law.""",186,bundle,is a,package,What is a bundle?,A bundle is a package.
the-red-swan,25,"When the bundle was laid before him, Maidwa opened one of the bags which
had been given to him. It was filled with various costly
articles--wampum, robes, and trinkets, of much richness and value;
these, in token of his kindness, he presented to the chief. The chief's
daughter stole a glance at the costly gifts, then at Maidwa and his
beautiful wife. She stopped working, and was silent and thoughtful all
the evening. The chief himself talked with Maidwa of his adventures,
congratulated him on his good fortune, and concluded by telling him that
he should take his daughter along with him in the morning.

Maidwa said ""Yes.""

The chief then spoke up, saying, ""Daughter, be ready to go with him in
the morning.""

Now it happened when the chief was thus speaking that there was a
foolish fellow in the lodge, who had thought to have got this chief's
daughter for a wife; and he jumped up, saying:

""Who is he,"" looking grimly at Maidwa, ""that he should take her for a
few presents? I will kill him.""

And he raised a knife which he had in his hand, and gave it a mighty
flourish in the air. He kept up this terrible flourish till some one
came and pulled him back to his seat, which he had been waiting for,
and then he sat quiet enough.",234,mighty,is the antonym of,feeble,What is the opposite of mighty?,Feeble.
the-red-swan,26,"Amid the greetings of their new friends, Maidwa and the Red Swan, with
the chief's daughter, took their leave by peep of day, and toward
evening they reached the other town. The watchman gave the signal, and
numbers of men, women and children stood out to see them. They were
again shown into the chief's lodge, who welcomed him, saying:

""Son-in-law, you are welcome.""

And he requested Maidwa to take a seat by his daughter, and the two
women did the same.

After suitable refreshment for all, and while Maidwa smoked a pipe, the
chief asked him to relate his adventures in the hearing of all the
inmates of the lodge, and of the strangers who had gathered in at report
of his singular fortunes.

Maidwa gave them his whole story. When he came to those parts which
related to the Red Swan, they turned and looked upon her in wonder and
admiration, for she was very beautiful.

The chief then informed Maidwa that his brothers had been to their town
in search of him, but that they had gone back some time before, having
given up all hopes of ever seeing him again. He added, that since he had
shown himself a man of spirit, whom fortune was pleased to befriend, he
should take his daughter with him.",119,relate,has subevent,tell,What does it mean to relate?,To relate means to tell in a descriptive way.

to enter any of our lodges. They merely inquired for you and returned.
You will take my daughter, treat her well, and that will bind us more
closely together.""

It is always the case in an assembly or gathering that some one of the
number is foolish, and disposed to play the clown. It happened to be so
here. One of this very sort was in the lodge, and, after Maidwa had
given the old chief presents, as he had to the other, this pretender
jumped up in a passion, and cried out:

""Who is this stranger, that he should have her? I want her myself.""

The chief bade him be quiet, and not to disturb or quarrel with one who
was enjoying their hospitality.

""No, no,"" he exclaimed, rushing forward as in act to strike.

Maidwa sat unmoved, and paid no heed to his threats.

He cried the louder--""I will have her, I will have her!"" whereupon the
old chief, being now vexed past patience, took his great war-club and
tapped this clownish fellow upon the head, which so far subdued him that
he sat for some time quite still; when, after a while, he came to
himself, the chief upbraided him for his folly, and told him to go out
and tell stories to the old women.",156,quarrel,has subevent,argue,What does it mean to quarrel?,To quarrel means to argue with someone.
the-red-swan,28,"When at last Maidwa was about to leave, he invited a number of the
families of the chief to go with him and visit their hunting-grounds,
where he promised them that they would find game in abundance. They
consented, and in the morning a large company assembled and joined
Maidwa; and the chief, with a party of warriors, escorted them a long
distance. When ready to return, the chief made a speech and besought the
blessing of the Good Spirit on Maidwa and his friends.

They parted, each on its course, making music with their war-drums,
which could be heard from afar as they glittered with waving feathers in
the morning sun, in their march over the prairie, which was lost in the
distant sky.

After several days' travel, Maidwa and his friends came in sight of his
home. The others rested within the woods while he went alone in advance
to see his brothers.",139,sky,has property,blue_on_clear_day,What's the color of the sky on a clear day?,The sky is blue on a clear day.
the-red-swan,29,"He entered the lodge. It was all in confusion and covered with ashes. On
one side, sitting among the cinders, with his face blackened, and crying
aloud, was his elder brother. On the other side sat the younger,
Jeekewis, also with blackened face, his head covered with stray feathers
and tufts of swan-down. This one presented so curious a figure that
Maidwa could not keep from laughing. He seemed to be so lost and
far-gone in grief that he could not notice his brother's arrival. The
eldest, however, after a while, lifting up his head, recognized Maidwa,
jumped up and shook hands, and kissed him, and expressed much joy at his
return.

Maidwa, as soon as he had seen the lodge set in order, made known that
he had brought each of them a wife. As soon as Jeekewis heard a wife
spoken of, he roused from his torpor, sprang to his feet, and said:

""Why is it just now that you have come?"" and at once made for the door
and peeped out to see the strangers. He then commenced jumping and
laughing, and crying out, ""Women! women!"" and that was all the reception
he gave his brother. Maidwa told them to wash themselves and prepare,
for he would go and fetch the females in.",202,door,is used for,separating_rooms,What is used to separate rooms?,Doors are used to separate rooms.
the-red-swan,30,"Jeekewis scampered about, and began to wash himself; but he would every
now and then, with one side of his head all feathers, and the other
clear and shining, peep forth to look at the women again. When they came
near, he said, ""I will have this and that one;"" he did not exactly know
which; he would sit down for an instant, and then rise, and peep about
and laugh; in fact he acted like one beside himself.

As soon as order was restored, and all the company who had been brought
in were seated, Maidwa presented one of the chief's daughters to his
eldest brother, saying: ""These women were given to me, to dispose of in
marriage. I now give one to each. I intended so from the first.""

Jeekewis spoke up and said, ""I think three wives would have been enough
for you.""

Maidwa led the other daughter to Jeekewis, and said, ""My brother, here
is one for you, and live happily.""

Jeekewis hung down his head as if he was ashamed, but he would every now
and then steal a look at his wife and also at the other women.

By and by he turned toward his wife and acted as if he had been married
for years.",141,marriage,is a,ritual,What is a marriage?,A marriage is a ritual for a couple to become husband and wife.
the-red-swan,31,"Maidwa seeing that no preparation had been made to entertain the
company, said, ""Are we to have no supper?""

He had no sooner spoken, than forth from a corner stepped the silent
kettle, which placed itself by the fire, and began bubbling and boiling
quite briskly. Presently that was joined by the big talking kettle,
which said, addressing itself to Maidwa, ""Master, we shall be ready
presently;"" and then, dancing along, came, from still another, the
frisky little kettle, which hopped to their side, and took an active
part in the preparations for the evening meal. When all was nearly
ready, a delicate voice was heard singing in the last corner of the
lodge, and keeping up its dainty carol all the way to the fire-place,
the fourth kettle joined the three cooks, and they all fell to with all
their might, and in the best possible humor, to dispatch their work.

It was not long before the big kettle advanced toward Maidwa, and said,
in his own confident way, ""Supper is ready!""

The feast was a jovial one; and although they were all hungry, and plied
their ladles with right good will, yet, dip in as often as they would,
the four magic kettles held out, and had plenty to the end of the revel.

To draw to a close, Maidwa and his friends lived in peace for a time;
their town prospered; there was no lack of children; and every thing
else was in abundance.",144,carol,is a,song,What is a carol?,"A carol is a song for specific festivals, Christmas for instance."
the-red-swan,32,"One day the two brothers began to look dark upon Maidwa, and to reproach
him for having taken from the medicine-sack their deceased father's
magic arrows; they upbraided him especially that one was lost.

After listening to them in silence, he said that he would go in search
of it, and that it should be restored; and the very next day, true to
his word, he left them.

After traveling a long way, and looking in every direction, almost
hopeless of discovering the lost treasure, he came to an opening in the
earth, and descending, it led him to the abode of departed spirits. The
country appeared beautiful, the pastures were greener than his own, and
the sky bluer than that which hung over the lodge, and the extent of it
was utterly lost in a dim distance; and he saw animals of every kind
wandering about in great numbers. The first he came to were buffalos;
his surprise was great when they addressed him as human beings.

They asked him what he came for, how he had descended, and why he was so
bold as to visit the abode of the dead.

He answered that he was in quest of a magic arrow, to appease the anger
of his brothers.",125,pasture,is a,grassland,What is a pasture?,A pasture is a field of grassland for herding livestocks.
the-red-swan,33,"""Very well,"" said the leader of the buffalos, whose form was nothing but
bone. ""Yes, we know it,"" and he and his followers moved off a little
space from Maidwa, as if they were afraid of him. ""You have come,""
resumed the buffalo-spirit, ""to a place where a living man has never
before been. You will return immediately to your tribe, for, under
pretense of recovering one of the magic arrows which belong to you by
your father's dying wish, they have sent you off that they might become
possessed of your beautiful wife, the Red Swan. Speed home! You will
find the magic arrow at the lodge-door. You will live to a very old age,
and die happily. You can go no further in these abodes of ours.""

Maidwa looked, as he thought, to the west, and saw a bright light as if
the sun was shining in its splendor, but he saw no sun.

""What light is that yonder?"" he asked.

The all-boned buffalo answered--""It is the place where those who were
good dwell.""

""And that dark cloud?"" Maidwa again asked.

""It is the place of the wicked,"" answered the buffalo.

Maidwa turned away, for it was very dark, and it pained his eyes to look
upon it; and, moving away by the aid of his guardian spirits, he again
stood upon the earth, and beheld the sun giving light as usual.",203,buffalo,is a,cow,What is a buffalo?,A buffalo is a relative of a cow.

After wandering a long time to gather knowledge to make his people happy
and to add to their comfort, he one evening drew near to his own
village. Passing all the other lodges he came to his own door, where he
found the magic arrow, as he had been promised. He heard his brothers
from within at high words with each other. They were quarreling for the
possession of his wife, who, through all his absence, had remained
constant, and sadly awaited his return. Maidwa listened in shame and
sorrow.

He entered the lodge, holding his head aloft as one conscious of good
principle and shining with anger. He spoke not a word, but, placing the
magic arrow to his bow, he would have laid his brothers dead at his
feet; but just then the talking kettle stepped forward and spoke such
words of wisdom, and the singing kettle trolled forth such a soothing
little song, and the guilty brothers were so contrite and keenly
repentant of their intended wrong, and the Red Swan was so radiant and
forgiving, the silent kettle straightway served them up so hearty and
wholesome a meal, and the frisky little kettle was so joyful and danced
about so merrily, that when the magic arrows were laid away in the
medicine-sack by Maidwa, there was that night in all the Indian country
no happier family than the three brothers, who ever after dwelt together
in all kindness, as all good brothers should.",133,listen,has subevent,pay_attention,What does it mean to listen?,To listen means to pay attention to a sound or speech.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,1,"There was once a rich old man who had two sons, and as his wife was
dead, the elder lived with him, and helped him to look after his
property. For a long time all went well; the young man got up very early
in the morning, and worked hard all day, and at the end of every week
his father counted up the money they had made, and rubbed his hands with
delight, as he saw how big the pile of gold in the strong iron chest was
becoming. 'It will soon be full now, and I shall have to buy a larger
one,' he said to himself, and so busy was he with the thought of his
money, that he did not notice how bright his son's face had grown, nor
how he sometimes started when he was spoken to, as if his mind was far
away.

One day, however, the old man went to the city on business, which he had
not done for three years at least. It was market day, and he met with
many people he knew, and it was getting quite late when he turned into
the inn yard, and bade an ostler saddle his horse, and bring it round
directly. While he was waiting in the hall, the landlady came up for a
gossip, and after a few remarks about the weather and the vineyards she
asked him how he liked his new daughter-in-law, and whether he had been
surprised at the marriage.",181,business,is used for,making_money,What do your parents do business for?,My parents do business for making money.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,2,"The old man stared as he listened to her. 'Daughter-in-law? Marriage?'
said he. 'I don't know what you are talking about! I've got no
daughter-in-law, and nobody has been married lately, that I ever heard
of.'

Now this was exactly what the landlady, who was very curious, wanted to
find out; but she put on a look of great alarm, and exclaimed:

'Oh, dear! I hope I have not made mischief. I had no idea--or, of
course, I would not have spoken--but'--and here she stopped and fumbled
with her apron, as if she was greatly embarrassed.",55,landlady,is a,landlord,What is a landlady?,A landlady is a female landlord.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,3,"'As you have said so much you will have to say a little more,' retorted
the old man, a suspicion of what she meant darting across him; and the
woman, nothing loth, answered as before.

'Ah, it was not all for buying or selling that your handsome son has
been coming to town every week these many months past. And not by the
shortest way, either! No, it was over the river he rode, and across the
hill and past the cottage of Miguel the vine-keeper, whose daughter,
they say, is the prettiest girl in the whole country side, though she is
too white for my taste,' and then the landlady paused again, and glanced
up at the farmer, to see how he was taking it. She did not learn much.
He was looking straight before him, his teeth set. But as she ceased to
talk, he said quietly, 'Go on.'

'There is not much more to tell,' replied the landlady, for she suddenly
remembered that she must prepare supper for the hungry men who always
stopped at the inn on market days, before starting for home, 'but one
fine morning they both went to the little church on top of the hill,
and were married. My cousin is servant to the priest, and she found out
about it and told me. But good-day to you, sir; here is your horse, and
I must hurry off to the kitchen.'",245,servant,is capable of,serve_master,What can servants do for the master?,Servants can serve the master.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,4,"It was lucky that the horse was sure-footed and knew the road, for his
bridle hung loose on his neck, and his master took no heed of the way
he was going. When the farm-house was reached, the man led the animal to
the stable, and then went to look for his son.

'I know everything--you have deceived me. Get out of my sight at once--I
have done with you,' he stammered, choking with passion as he came up to
the young man, who was cutting a stick in front of the door, whistling
gaily the while.

'But, father--'

'You are no son of mine; I have only one now. Begone, or it will be the
worse for you,' and as he spoke he lifted up his whip.

The young man shrank back. He feared lest his father should fall down in
a fit, his face was so red and his eyes seemed bursting from his head.
But it was no use staying: perhaps next morning the old man might listen
to reason, though in his heart the son felt that he would never take
back his words. So he turned slowly away, and walked heavily along a
path which ended in a cave on the side of his hill, and there he sat
through the night, thinking of what had happened.",243,hill,is at location of,countryside,Where can we usually see hills?,We can usually see hills in the countryside.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,5,"Yes, he had been wrong, there was no doubt of that, and he did not quite
know how it had come about. He had meant to have told his father all
about it, and he was sure, quite sure, that if once the old man had seen
his wife, he would have forgiven her poverty on account of her great
beauty and goodness. But he had put it off from day to day, hoping
always for a better opportunity, and now this was the end!

If the son had no sleep that night, no more had the father, and as soon
as the sun rose, he sent a messenger into the great city with orders to
bring back the younger brother. When he arrived the farmer did not waste
words, but informed him that he was now his only heir, and would inherit
all his lands and money, and that he was to come and live at home, and
to help manage the property.

Though very pleased at the thought of becoming such a rich man--for the
brothers had never cared much for each other--the younger would rather
have stayed where he was, for he soon got tired of the country, and
longed for a town life. However, this he kept to himself, and made the
best of things, working hard like his brother before him.",148,inform,causes,send_e_mail,What can you do to inform someone of something?,I can send an e-mail.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,6,"In this way the years went on, but the crops were not so good as they
had been, and the old man gave orders that some fine houses he was
building in the city should be left unfinished, for it would take all
the savings to complete them. As to the elder son, he would never even
hear his name mentioned, and died at last without ever seeing his face,
leaving to the younger, as he had promised, all his lands, as well as
his money.

Meanwhile, the son whom he had disinherited had grown poorer and poorer.
He and his wife were always looking out for something to do, and never
spent a penny that they could help, but luck was against them, and at
the time of his father's death they had hardly bread to eat or clothes
to cover them. If there had been only himself, he would have managed
to get on somehow, but he could not bear to watch his children becoming
weaker day by day, and swallowing his pride, at length he crossed the
mountains to his old home where his brother was living.",128,penny,is part of,british_pound,What is a penny?,A penny is a part of British pound.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,7,"It was the first time for long that the two men had come face to face,
and they looked at each other in silence. Then tears rose in the eyes of
the elder, but winking them hastily away, he said:

'Brother, it is not needful that I should tell you how poor I am; you
can see that for yourself. I have not come to beg for money, but only
to ask if you will give me those unfinished houses of yours in the city,
and I will make them watertight, so that my wife and children can live
in them, and that will save our rent. For as they are, they profit you
nothing.'

And the younger brother listened and pitied him, and gave him the houses
that he asked for, and the elder went away happy.",73,beg,is a,ask,What does it mean by begging for help?,Begging for help means asking someone for help.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,8,"For some years things went on as they were, and then the rich brother
began to feel lonely, and thought to himself that he was getting older,
and it was time for him to be married. The wife he chose was very
wealthy, but she was also very greedy, and however much she had, she
always wanted more. She was, besides, one of those unfortunate people
who invariably fancy that the possessions of other people must be better
than their own. Many a time her poor husband regretted the day that he
had first seen her, and often her meanness and shabby ways put him to
shame. But he had not the courage to rule her, and she only got worse
and worse.

After she had been married a few months the bride wanted to go into the
city and buy herself some new dresses. She had never been there before,
and when she had finished her shopping, she thought she would pay a
visit to her unknown sister-in-law, and rest for a bit. The house
she was seeking was in a broad street, and ought to have been very
magnificent, but the carved stone portico enclosed a mean little door
of rough wood, while a row of beautiful pillars led to nothing. The
dwelling on each side were in the same unfinished condition, and water
trickled down the walls. Most people would have considered it a wretched
place, and turned their backs on it as soon as they could, but this lady
saw that by spending some money the houses could be made as splendid as
they were originally intended to be, and she instantly resolved to get
them for herself.",185,unknown,is the antonym of,known,What is the antonym of unknown?,Known.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,9,"Full of this idea she walked up the marble staircase, and entered
the little room where her sister-in-law sat, making clothes for her
children. The bride seemed full of interest in the houses, and asked
a great many questions about them, so that her new relations liked her
much better than they expected, and hoped they might be good friends.
However, as soon as she reached home, she went straight to her husband,
and told him that he must get back those houses from his brother, as
they would exactly suit her, and she could easily make them into a
palace as fine as the king's. But her husband only told her that she
might buy houses in some other part of the town, for she could not have
those, as he had long since made a gift of them to his brother, who had
lived there for many years past.",9,staircase,is used for,going_upstairs,What are staircases used for?,Staircases are used for going upstairs.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,10,"At this answer the wife grew very angry. She began to cry, and made such
a noise that all the neighbours heard her and put their heads out of the
windows, to see what was the matter. 'It was absurd,' she sobbed out,
'quite unjust. Indeed, if you came to think of it, the gift was worth
nothing, as when her husband made it he was a bachelor, and since then
he had been married, and she had never given her consent to any such
thing.' And so she lamented all day and all night, till the poor man
was nearly worried to death; and at last he did what she wished, and
summoned his brother in a court of law to give up the houses which, he
said, had only been lent to him. But when the evidence on both sides had
been heard, the judge decided in favour of the poor man, which made the
rich lady more furious than ever, and she determined not to rest until
she had gained the day. If one judge would not give her the houses
another should, and so time after time the case was tried over again,
till at last it came before the highest judge of all, in the city of
Evora. Her husband was heartily tired and ashamed of the whole affair,
but his weakness in not putting a stop to it in the beginning had got
him into this difficulty, and now he was forced to go on.",131,summon,has subevent,call,What does it mean by summoning someone?,Summoning someone means calling people together.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,11,"On the same day the two brothers set out on their journey to the city,
the rich one on horseback, with plenty of food in his knapsack, the poor
one on foot with nothing but a piece of bread and four onions to eat
on the way. The road was hilly and neither could go very fast, and when
night fell, they were both glad to see some lights in a window a little
distance in front of them.

The lights turned out to have been placed there by a farmer, who
had planned to have a particularly good supper as it was his wife's
birthday, and bade the rich man enter and sit down, while he himself
took the horse to the stable. The poor man asked timidly if he might
spend the night in a corner, adding that he had brought his own supper
with him. Another time permission might have been refused him, for the
farmer was no lover of humble folk, but now he gave the elder brother
leave to come in, pointing out a wooden chair where he could sit.

Supper was soon served, and very glad the younger brother was to eat it,
for his long ride had made him very hungry. The farmer's wife, however,
would touch nothing, and at last declared that the only supper she
wanted was one of the onions the poor man was cooking at the fire. Of
course he gave it to her, though he would gladly have eaten it himself,
as three onions are not much at the end of a long day's walk, and soon
after they all went to sleep, the poor man making himself as comfortable
as he could in his corner.",20,horseback,is part of,horse,What is horseback?,"Horseback is part of a horse, the back of a horse."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,12,"A few hours later the farmer was aroused by the cries and groans of his
wife.

'Oh, I feel so ill, I'm sure I'm going to die,' wept she. 'It was that
onion, I know it was. I wish I had never eaten it. It must have been
poisoned.'

'If the man has poisoned you he shall pay for it,' said her husband, and
seizing a thick stick he ran downstairs and began to beat the poor
man, who had been sound asleep, and had nothing to defend himself
with. Luckily, the noise aroused the younger brother, who jumped up and
snatched the stick from the farmer's hand, saying:

'We are both going to Evora to try a law-suit. Come too, and accuse him
there if he has attempted to rob you or murder you, but don't kill him
now, or you will get yourself into trouble.'

'Well, perhaps you are right,' answered the farmer, 'but the sooner that
fellow has his deserts, the better I shall be pleased,' and without more
words he went to the stables and brought out a horse for himself and
also the black Andalusian mare ridden by the rich man, while the poor
brother, fearing more ill-treatment, started at once on foot.",22,ill,causes,go_to_doctor,What will you do if you are ill?,I will go to see a doctor.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,13,"Now all that night it had rained heavily, and did not seem likely to
stop, and in some places the road was so thick with mud that it was
almost impossible to get across it. In one spot it was so very bad that
a mule laden with baggage had got stuck in it, and tug as he might,
his master was quite unable to pull him out. The muleteer in despair
appealed to the two horseman, who were carefully skirting the swamp at
some distance off, but they paid no heed to his cries, and he began to
talk cheerfully to his mule, hoping to keep up his spirits, declaring
that if the poor beast would only have a little patience help was sure
to come.",51,baggage,is at location of,airport,Where do we usually see baggage?,We usually see baggage s at the airport.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,14,"And so it did, for very soon the poor brother reached the place,
bespattered with mud from head to foot, but ready to do all he could
to help with the mule and his master. First they set about finding some
stout logs of wood to lay down on the marsh so that they could reach the
mule, for by this time his frantic struggles had broken his bridle, and
he was deeper in than ever. Stepping cautiously along the wood, the poor
man contrived to lay hold of the animal's tale, and with a desperate
effort the mule managed to regain his footing on dry ground, but at the
cost of leaving his tail in the poor man's hand. When he saw this the
muleteer's anger knew no bounds, and forgetting that without the help
given him he would have lost his mule altogether, he began to abuse the
poor man, declaring that he had ruined his beast, and the law would make
him pay for it. Then, jumping on the back of the mule, which was so glad
to be out of the choking mud that he did not seem to mind the loss of
his tail, the ungrateful wretch rode on, and that evening reached the
inn at Evora, where the rich man and the farmer had already arrived for
the night.",158,mule,is a,horse,What is a mule?,A mule is a male or female hybrid offspring of a male donkey and a female horse.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,15,"Meanwhile the poor brother walked wearily along, wondering what other
dreadful adventures were in store for him.

'I shall certainly be condemned for one or other of them,' thought he
sadly; 'and after all, if I have to die, I would rather choose my own
death than leave it to my enemies,' and as soon as he entered Evora he
looked about for a place suitable for carrying out the plan he had made.
At length he found what he sought, but as it was too late and too dark
for him to make sure of success, he curled himself up under a doorway,
and slept till morning.

Although it was winter, the sun rose in a clear sky, and its rays felt
almost warm when the poor man got up and shook himself. He intended it
to be the day of his death, but in spite of that, and of the fact
that he was leaving his wife and children behind him, he felt almost
cheerful. He had struggled so long, and was so very, very tired; but he
would not have minded that if he could have proved his innocence, and
triumphed over his enemies. However, they had all been too clever for
him, and he had no strength to fight any more. So he mounted the stone
steps that led to the battlements of the city, and stopped for a moment
to gaze about him.",116,doorway,is used for,enter_room,What is the doorway used for?,The doorway is used for entering the room.
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,16,"It happened that an old sick man who lived near by had begged to be
carried out and to be laid at the foot of the wall so that the beams of
the rising sun might fall upon him, and he would be able to talk with
his friends as they passed by to their work. Little did he guess that
on top of the battlements, exactly over his head, stood a man who was
taking his last look at the same sun, before going to his death that
awaited him. But so it was; and as the steeple opposite was touched by
the golden light, the poor man shut his eyes and sprang forward. The
wall was high, and he flew rapidly through the air, but it was not the
ground he touched, only the body of the sick man, who rolled over and
died without a groan. As for the other, he was quite unhurt, and was
slowly rising to his feet when his arms were suddenly seized and held.",185,seize,has subevent,take,What does it mean by seizing someone by their hands?,Seizing someone by their hands means taking someone by their hands.

men, 'and you will come with us this instant before the judge, and
answer for it.'

'Your father? but I don't know him. What do you mean?' asked the poor
man, who was quite bewildered with his sudden rush through the air, and
could not think why he should be accused of this fresh crime. But he got
no reply, and was only hurried through the streets to the court-house,
where his brother, the muleteer, and the farmer had just arrived, all as
angry as ever, all talking at once, till the judge entered and ordered
them to be silent.

'I will hear you one by one,' he said, and motioned the younger brother
to begin.

He did not take long to state his case. The unfinished houses were his,
left him with the rest of the property by his father, and his brother
refused to give them up. In answer, the poor man told, in a few words,
how he had begged the houses from his brother, and produced the deed of
gift which made him their owner.

The judge listened quietly and asked a few questions; then he gave his
verdict.",107,muleteer,is a,laborer,What is a muleteer?,A muleteer is a laborer who drives mules.

given, and to whom they belong. And as you,' he added, turning to the
younger brother, 'brought this accusation knowing full well it was
wicked and unjust, I order you, besides losing the houses, to pay a
thousand pounds damages to your brother.'

The rich man heard the judge with rage in his heart, the poor man with
surprise and gratitude. But he was not safe yet, for now it was the turn
of the farmer. The judge could hardly conceal a smile at the story,
and inquired if the wife was dead before the farmer left the house, and
received for answer that he was in such a hurry for justice to be done
that he had not waited to see. Then the poor man told his tale, and once
more judgment was given in his favour, while twelve hundred pounds
was ordered to be paid him. As for the muleteer, he was informed very
plainly that he had proved himself mean and ungrateful for the help that
had been given him, and as a punishment he must pay to the poor man a
fine of fifty pounds, and hand him over the mule till his tail had grown
again.

Lastly, there came the two sons of the sick man.",74,rage,is a,anger,What is rage?,Rage is uncontrolled anger.

poor man told how he had leaped from the wall, not knowing that anyone
was beneath.

'Well, this is my judgment,' replied the judge, when they had all
spoken: 'Let the accused sit under the wall, and let the sons of the
dead man jump from the top and fall on him and kill him, and if they
will not to this, then they are condemned to pay eight hundred pounds
for their false accusation.'

The young men looked at each other, and slowly shook their heads.

'We will pay the fine,' said they, and the judge nodded.

enough money to keep them in comfort to the end of their days.",155,nod,is a,gesture,What is a nod?,A nod is gesture of shaking your head up and down to show agreement.

was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and
whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!

On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.

She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.

Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten.

walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside
them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there
were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared
at night--especially cheese and bacon.

Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.

While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got
into mischief.

The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.

They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before

yeast.

poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in

in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard
a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.

""Yes, it is infested with rats,"" said Tabitha tearfully, ""I caught seven
young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for
dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old
rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his
yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.""

seemed to be in a terrible fright.

""Oh! Mother, Mother,"" said Moppet, ""there's been an old woman rat in the
kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!""

The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks
of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!

dreadful enormous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and
the rolling-pin.""

Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.

""A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!"" exclaimed Tabitha,
wringing her paws.

was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.

""This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,"" said Ribby. ""We must send for John
Joiner at once, with a saw.""

Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very
unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does
not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.

Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that
his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.

He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the
chimney.

The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a
white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender

the-roly-poly-pudding,9,"The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk
about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.

He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron
bar where the kettle hangs.

Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high
up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.

Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks
beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below. He made up
his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try
to catch sparrows.

""I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my
beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.""

The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days
when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.

The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and
the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that
kept out the rain.",35,fireplace,is capable of,heat_room,What can a fireplace do for a room?,A fireplace can heat the room.
the-roly-poly-pudding,10,"Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up.

Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little
sweep himself.

It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another.

There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.

He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to
a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some
mutton bones lying about--

""This seems funny,"" said Tom Kitten. ""Who has been gnawing bones up here
in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell! It is
something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,"" said
Tom Kitten.

He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a
most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.

He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the
skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the
picture.",170,passage,is capable of,walk_through,What can a passage do?,A passage can let people walk through.
the-roly-poly-pudding,11,"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed
on a heap of very dirty rags.

When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him--he found himself
in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his
life in the house.

It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and
cobwebs, and lath and plaster.

Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.

""What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?"" said
the rat, chattering his teeth.

""Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,"" said poor Tom Kitten.

""Anna Maria! Anna Maria!"" squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise
and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.

All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was
happening--

His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with
string in very hard knots.",148,squeak,is a,noise,What is a squeak?,"A squeak is a short, high-pitched noise."
the-roly-poly-pudding,12,"Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When
she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.

""Anna Maria,"" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel
Whiskers),--""Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for
my dinner.""

""It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,"" said Anna
Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.

""No,"" said Samuel Whiskers, ""make it properly, Anna Maria, with
breadcrumbs.""

""Nonsense! Butter and dough,"" replied Anna Maria.

The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.

Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down

anybody.",60,pudding,is a,dessert,What is a pudding?,A pudding is a dessert.

him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.

He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the
candle to look into the chest.

They did not see him.

Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter
to the kitchen to steal the dough.

She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws.

She did not observe Moppet.

While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he
wriggled about and tried to mew for help.

But his mouth was full of soot and cob-webs, and he was tied up in such
very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.

Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined
the knots critically, from a safe distance.",140,knot,is used for,tie,What do people usually use knots for?,People usually use knots for tying things up.
the-roly-poly-pudding,14,"It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate
blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.

Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.

Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a
dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him
in the dough.

""Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?"" inquired Samuel
Whiskers.

Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she
wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the
pastry. She laid hold of his ears.

Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin
went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.

""His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.""

""I fetched as much as I could carry,"" replied Anna Maria.

""I do not think""--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom
Kitten--""I do NOT think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.""",113,pastry,is a,baked_food,What is pastry?,Pastry is baked food item made from flour.
the-roly-poly-pudding,15,"Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to
be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a
little dog, scratching and yelping!

The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.

""We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our
property,--and other people's,--and depart at once.""

""I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.""

""But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible,
whatever you may urge to the contrary.""

counterpane,"" said Anna Maria. ""I have got half a smoked ham hidden in
the chimney.""",128,mutton,is a,adult_sheep,What is mutton?,Mutton is adult sheep.

was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a
very dirty dumpling!

But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of
the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round
and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.

Then he nailed the plank down again, and put his tools in his bag, and
came downstairs.

The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner.

The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a
bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.

They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the
butter off.

John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to
stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for
Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.

And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the
lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the

Of course it was a smaller place than upstairs, but it was more comfortable, for I wasn't chased about and teased by the children as I had been before. My food was just as good, or even better.

'I can't stand it any longer!' he said. 'How beautiful it looks with its tongue stretched out like that!'

It was a long night, but the Snow-man did not find it so; there he stood, wrapt in his pleasant thoughts, and they froze, so that he cracked.

Next morning the panes of the kitchen window were covered with ice, and the most beautiful ice-flowers that even a snow-man could desire, only they blotted out the stove. The window would not open; he couldn't see the stove which he thought was such a lovely lady.

The first words that they heard in this world, when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off, were: 'Hurrah, tin-soldiers!' This was exclaimed by a little boy, clapping his hands; they had been given to him because it was his birthday, and now he began setting them out on the table.

That was all very pretty; but the most beautiful thing was a little lady, who stood in the open doorway. She was cut out of paper, but she had on a dress of the finest muslin, with a scarf of narrow blue ribbon round her shoulders, fastened in the middle with a glittering rose made of gold paper, which was as large as her head.

That was a terrible fall, I can tell you! He landed on his head with his leg in the air, his gun being wedged between two paving-stones.

The nursery-maid and the little boy came down at once to look for him, but, though they were so near him that they almost trod on him, they did not notice him.

But the current became swifter and stronger. The Tin-soldier could already see daylight where the tunnel ended; but in his ears there sounded a roaring enough to frighten any brave man.

The boat whirled three, four times round, and became filled to the brim with water: it began to sink! The Tin-soldier was standing up to his neck in water, and deeper and deeper sank the boat, and softer and softer grew the paper; now the water was over his head. He was thinking of the pretty little Dancer, whose face he should never see again, and there sounded in his ears, over and over again:

The fish had been caught, taken to market, sold, and brought into the kitchen, where the cook had cut it open with a great knife. She took up the soldier between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room, where everyone wanted to see the hero who had been found inside a fish; but the Tin-soldier was not at all proud. They put him on the table, and-no, but what strange things do happen in this world!-the Tin-soldier was in the same room in which he had been before! He saw the same children, and the same toys on the table; and there was the same grand castle with the pretty little Dancer. She was still standing on one leg with the other high in the air; she too was steadfast. That touched the Tin-soldier, he was nearly going to shed tin-tears; but that would not have been fitting for a soldier. He looked at her, but she said nothing.

All at once one of the little boys took up the Tin-soldier, and threw him into the stove, giving no reasons; but doubtless the little black imp in the snuff-box was at the bottom of this too.",29,lightning,is a,atmospheric_electricity,What is the cause of a lightning?,Atmospheric electricity.

He looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt that he was melting; but he remained steadfast, with his gun at his shoulder. Suddenly a door opened, the draught caught up the little Dancer, and off she flew like a sylph to the Tin-soldier in the stove, burst into flames-and that was the end of her! Then the Tin-soldier melted down into a little lump, and when next morning the maid was taking out the ashes, she found him in the shape of a heart.

the-straw-the-coal-and-the-bean,1,"THERE lived in a certain village a poor old woman who had collected a
mess of beans, and was going to cook them. So she made a fire on her
hearth. In order to make it burn better, she put in a handful of
straw. When the beans began to bubble in the pot, one of them fell out
and lay, never noticed, near a straw which was already there. Soon a
red-hot coal jumped out of the fire and joined the pair. The straw began
first, and said,

""Dear friends, how do you come here?"" The coal answered,

""I jumped out of the fire by great good luck, or I should certainly have
met with my death. I should have been burned to ashes."" The bean said,

""I too have come out of it with a whole skin. If the old woman had
kept me in the pot I should have been cooked into a soft mass like my
comrades.""

""Nor should I have met with a better fate,"" said the straw. ""The old
woman has turned my brothers into fire and smoke, sixty of them she took
up at once and deprived of life. Very luckily I managed to slip through
her fingers.""

""What had we better do now?"" said the coal.

""I think,"" answered the bean, ""that as we have been so lucky as to
escape with our lives, we will join in good fellowship together.
Lest any more bad fortune should happen to us here, we will go abroad
into foreign lands.""",14,mess,has subevent,disorder,What could mess cause?,Disorder.

stepping-stone, and no bridge, they could not tell how they were to get
to the other side. The straw was struck with a good idea, and said,

""I will lay myself across, so that you can go over me as if I were a
bridge!""

So the straw stretched himself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
who was of an ardent nature, quickly trotted up to go over the new-made
bridge. When, however, she reached the middle, and heard the water
rushing past beneath her, she was struck with terror, and stopped, and
could get no farther. So the straw began to get burnt, broke in two
pieces, and fell in the brook. The coal slipped down, hissing as she
touched the water, and gave up the ghost. The bean, who had prudently
remained behind on the bank, could not help laughing at the sight.
Not being able to contain herself, she went on laughing so excessively that
she burst. And now would she certainly have been undone for ever, if a
tailor on his travels had not by good luck stopped to rest himself by
the brook. As he had a compassionate heart, he took out needle and
thread and stitched her together again. The bean thanked him in the most
elegant manner, but as he had sewn her up with black stitches, all beans
since then have a black seam.",21,brook,is a,small_stream_of_water,What's brook?,Small stream of water.

Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had
no top!

And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things
spread upon the grass.

LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her;

of a VERY small person.

THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and
there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited
rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!

But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside
it some one was singing--

Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the
hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just
like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's
head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was
everything there.

THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her
hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.

Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her
striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle,

chuckled--""Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store
for winter and spring."" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the

Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away
quietly by themselves.

EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They
carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near
the tree where they had built their nest.

WHEN these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole
high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled
down--down--down inside.

bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and
it sang--""Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts? Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?""

the little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too

hurted him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk
appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?

It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the
house was full of provisions.

THE Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the
tree--""Besides, I found a few buried!"" It laughed and chuckled when it
heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it enticed him to
eat quantities--""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I

rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful,
there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful,
a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.

for her, and she got a pain in her eyes. Fortunately she scrambled out
of the bucket. But she fell into the water with a terrible flop, and
had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back. She certainly
had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and
all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world. The

jewel in his head, or else I have the jewel.""

The young frogs listened and stared. As these words did not
please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water. But
the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere pride, for each
of them thought that he must have the jewel. Then they sat and
held their heads quite still. But at length they asked what it was

""Well, I haven't got the jewel,"" said the smallest of the Toads;
she was as ugly as a toad can be. ""Why should I have such a precious
thing? And if it makes others angry, it can't give me any pleasure.
No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well, and look out. It must be beautiful up there.""

""You'd better stay where you are,"" said the old Mother-Toad,
""for you know everything here, and you can tell what you have. Take
care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death. Even if you
get into it safely, you may fall out. And it's not every one who falls

look over. She felt such a longing for the green, up there. The
next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn up,
filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the stone

just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles
which grew high by the well's brink. Here she saw stem by stem, but
she looked up also. The sun shone through the leaves, which were quite

I have come so far, I must try to go still farther."" And so she
crawled on as fast as she could crawl. She got out upon the highway,
where the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over as
she marched across the way.

colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly, too, was flitting by.
The Toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that it
might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural

experienced no want of provisions. On the ninth day she thought,
""Forward! onward!"" But what could she find more charming and
beautiful? Perhaps a little toad or a few green frogs. During the last
night there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there were
cousins in the neighborhood.

""It's a glorious thing to live! glorious to get out of the well,
and to lie among the stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the dusty
road. But onward, onward! that we may find frogs or a little toad.
We can't do without that. Nature alone is not enough for one."" And
so she went forward on her journey.

She came out into the open field, to a great pond, round about
which grew reeds. She walked into it.

the whole pond was free.

""Now I shall resume my journey,"" said the little Toad. She
always felt a longing for something better.

She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw the
moon gleaming. Then she saw the sun rise, and mount higher and
higher.

""Perhaps after all, I am still in a well, only in a larger well. I
must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing."" And
when the moon became round and full, the poor creature thought, ""I
wonder if that is the bucket which will be let down, and into which
I must step to get higher up? Or is the sun the great bucket? How
great it is! how bright it is! It can take up all. I must look out,
that I may not miss the opportunity. Oh, how it seems to shine in my
head! I don't think the jewel can shine brighter. But I haven't the
jewel; not that I cry about that--no, I must go higher up, into
splendor and joy! I feel so confident, and yet I am afraid. It's a

straight onward!""",268,afraid,causes,run,What do we do when we feel afraid?,We run.
the-toad,12,"She took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take, and soon
found herself on a road beside which people dwelt. There were
flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens. And she sat down to rest by
a kitchen garden.

""What a number of different creatures there are that I never knew!
and how beautiful and great the world is! But one must look round in
it, and not stay in one spot."" And then she hopped into the kitchen
garden. ""How green it is here! how beautiful it is here!""

""I know that,"" said the Caterpillar, on the leaf, ""my leaf is
the largest here. It hides half the world from me, but I don't care
for the world.""

""Cluck, cluck!"" And some fowls came. They tripped about in the
cabbage garden. The Fowl who marched at the head of them had a long
sight. She spied the Caterpillar on the green leaf, and pecked
at it, so that the Caterpillar fell on the ground, where it twisted
and writhed.",189,leaf,is part of,tree,Where can we see leaves?,Near the tree.

other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would be.

lifted up her head to peck at the Caterpillar.

The Toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling straight
up towards the Fowl.

""Aha, it has allies,"" quoth the Fowl. ""Just look at the crawling
thing!"" And then the Fowl turned away. ""I don't care for the little
green morsel; it would only tickle my throat."" The other fowls took
the same view of it, and they all turned away together.

""I writhed myself free,"" said the Caterpillar. ""What a good
thing it is when one has presence of mind! But the hardest thing
remains to be done, and that is to get on my leaf again. Where is it?""",118,throat,is part of,neck,Where is your throat?,It's in my neck.
the-toad,14,"And the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy. She was
glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.

""What do you mean by that?"" cried the Caterpillar. ""I wriggled
myself free from the Fowl. You are very disagreeable to look at.
Cannot I be left in peace on my own property? Now I smell cabbage. Now
I am near my leaf. Nothing is so beautiful as property. But I must
go higher up.""

""Yes, higher up,"" said the little Toad; ""higher-up! She feels just
as I do; but she's not in a good humor to-day. That's because of the
fright. We all want to go higher up."" And she looked up as high as
ever she could.

The stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farm-house. He
clapped with his beak, and the Mother-stork clapped with hers.

the-toad,15,"In the farm-house lived two young students; the one was a poet and
the other a scientific searcher into the secrets of nature. The one
sang and wrote joyously of everything that God had created, and how it
was mirrored in his heart. He sang it out clearly, sweetly, richly, in
well-sounding verses; while the other investigated created matter
itself, and even cut it open where need was. He looked upon God's
creation as a great sum in arithmetic--subtracted, multiplied, and
tried to know it within and without, and to talk with understanding
concerning it; and that was a very sensible thing; and he spoke
joyously and cleverly of it. They were good, joyful men, those two.

""There sits a good specimen of a toad,"" said the naturalist. ""I
must have that fellow in a bottle of spirits.""

""You have two of them already,"" replied the poet. ""Let the thing
sit there and enjoy its life.""

""But it's so wonderfully ugly,"" persisted the first.

""Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head,"" said the poet, ""I
too should be for cutting it open.""

""A jewel!"" cried the naturalist. ""You seem to know a great deal
about natural history.""

""But is there not something beautiful in the popular belief that
just as the toad is the ugliest of animals, it should often carry

herself. ""What a good thing that I have not got it! I might have
been in a very disagreeable position.""

language truly! Why, it changes in every day's journey we make. One of
them doesn't understand another. Now, we can speak our language over
the whole earth--up in the North and in Egypt. And then men are not
able to fly, moreover. They rush along by means of an invention they
call 'railway;' but they often break their necks over it. It makes
my beak turn cold when I think of it. The world could get on without
men. We could do without them very well, so long as we only keep frogs
and earth-worms.""

""That was a powerful speech,"" thought the little Toad. ""What a

charming to the little Toad.

""I must go to Egypt!"" said she. ""If the Stork or one of his
young ones would only take me! I would oblige him in return. Yes, I
shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy! All the longing and all the
pleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in one's
head.""

Egypt--and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a spark
seemed to fly out of them.

shot forth from her eyes; what became of that?

yet finds the shortest way home to the same country--to the same roof.

in the woods with nobody near her but her little dog; for, to her
surprise, she found fresh meat every morning at her door. She was very
curious to know who it was that supplied her, and watching one morning,
just as the sun had risen, she saw a handsome young man gliding away
into the forest. Having seen her, he became her husband, and she had a
son by him.

One day, not long after this, he did not return at evening, as usual,
from hunting. She waited till late at night, but he came no more.

The next day, she swung her child to sleep in its cradle, and then said
to her dog, ""Take care of your brother while I am gone, and when he
cries, halloo for me.""

of her child's cradle, and she knew that the dog had been faithful, and
had striven his best to save her child from being carried off, as he had
been, by an old woman, from a distant country, called Mukakee Mindemoea,
or the Toad-Woman.

The mother hurried off at full speed in pursuit, and as she flew along,
she came, from time to time, to lodges inhabited by old women, who told
her at what time the child-thief had passed; they also gave her shoes
that she might follow on. There was a number of these old women who
seemed as if they were prophetesses, and knew what was to come long
beforehand. Each of them would say to her that when she had arrived at
the next lodge, she must set the toes of the moccasins they had given
her pointing homeward, and that they would return of themselves. The

she borrowed.",107,speed,is a,rate_of_motion,What is speed?,The rate of motion.

of the last of the friendly old grandmothers, as they were called, who
gave her the last instructions how to proceed. She told her that she
was near the place where her son was to be found; and she directed her
to build a lodge of cedar-boughs, hard by the old Toad-Woman's lodge,
and to make a little bark dish, and to fill it with the juice of the
wild grape.

""Then,"" she said, ""your first child (meaning the dog) will come and find
you out.""

These directions the young woman followed just as they had been given to
her, and in a short time she heard her son, now grown up, going out to
hunt, with his dog, calling out to him, ""Peewaubik--Spirit-Iron--Twee!

gives you.""

eyes wide open; for it was the drink which teaches one to see the truth
of things as they are. He rose up when he got into the open air, stood
upon his hind legs, and looked about. ""I see how it is,"" he said; and
marching off, erect like a man, he sought out his young master.

Approaching him in great confidence, he bent down and whispered in his
ear (having first looked cautiously around to see that no one was
listening), ""This old woman here in the lodge is no mother of yours. I
have found your real mother, and she is worth looking at. When we come
back from our day's sport, I'll prove it to you.""",128,confidence,is a,attitude,What is confidence?,An positive attitude of self-assurance.

brought back a great spoil of meat of all kinds. The young man, as soon
as he had laid aside his weapons, said to the old Toad-Woman, ""Send some
of the best of this meat to the stranger who has arrived lately.""

The Toad-Woman answered, ""No! Why should I send to her, the poor widow!""

The young man would not be refused; and at last the old Toad-Woman
consented to take something and throw it down at the door. She called
out, ""My son gives you this."" But, being bewitched by Mukakee Mindemoea,
it was so bitter and distasteful, that the young woman immediately cast
it out of the lodge after her.

In the evening the young man paid the stranger a visit at her lodge of
cedar-boughs. She then told him that she was his real mother, and that
he had been stolen away from her by the old Toad-Woman, who was a
child-thief and a witch. As the young man appeared to doubt, she added,
""Feign yourself sick when you go home to her lodge; and when the
Toad-Woman asks what ails you, say that you wish to see your cradle; for
your cradle was of wampum, and your faithful brother the dog, in
striving to save you, tore off these pieces which I show you.""",89,refuse,is the antonym of,accept,What is refuse?,Not accept.

Spirit-Iron, taking his arm, kept close by his side, and gave him many
words of encouragement as they went along. They entered the lodge
together; and the old Toad-Woman saw, from something in the dog's eye,
that trouble was coming.

""Mother,"" said the young man, placing his hand to his head, and leaning
heavily upon Spirit-Iron, as if a sudden faintness had come upon him,
""why am I so different in looks from the rest of your children?""

""Oh,"" she answered, ""it was a very bright, clear blue sky when you were
born; that is the reason.""

He seemed to be so very ill that the Toad-Woman at length asked what she
could do for him. He said nothing could do him good but the sight of his
cradle. She ran immediately and brought a cedar cradle; but he said:

""That is not my cradle.""",37,belief,causes,trust,What is the belief?,To trust something is true.

were four; but he turned his head, and said:

When she had shown the four, and they had been all rejected, she at last
produced the real cradle. The young man saw that it was of the same
stuff as the wampum which he had in his bosom. He could even see the
marks of the teeth of Spirit-Iron left upon the edges, where he had
taken hold, striving to hold it back. He had no doubt, now, which was
his mother.

To get free of the old Toad-Woman, it was necessary that the young man
should kill a fat bear; and, being directed by Spirit-Iron, who was very
wise in such a matter, he secured the fattest in all that country; and
having stripped a tall pine of all its bark and branches, he perched the
carcass in the top, with its head to the east and its tail due west.
Returning to the lodge, he informed the old Toad-Woman that the fat bear
was ready for her, but that she would have to go very far, even to the
end of the earth, to get it. She answered:

""It is not so far but that I can get it;"" for of all things in the

man and his dog, Spirit-Iron, blowing a strong breath in the face of the
Toad-Woman's four children (who were all bad spirits, or bear-fiends),
they put out their life. They then set them up by the side of the door,
having first thrust a piece of the white fat in each of their mouths.

The Toad-Woman spent a long time in finding the bear which she had been
sent after, and she made at least five and twenty attempts before she
was able to climb to the carcass. She slipped down three times where she
went up once. When she returned with the great bear on her back, as she
drew near her lodge she was astonished to see the four children standing
up by the door-posts with the fat in their mouths. She was angry with
them, and called out:

""Why do you thus insult the pomatum of your brother?""",180,insult,is capable of,make_person_angry,What may happen when we insult someone?,We may make the person angry.

when she found that they were stark dead, and placed in this way to mock
her, her fury was very great indeed. She ran after the tracks of the
young man and his mother as fast as she could; so fast, indeed, that she
was on the very point of overtaking them, when the dog, Spirit-Iron,
coming close up to his master, whispered to him--""Snakeberry!""

""Let the snakeberry spring up to detain her!"" cried out the young man;
and immediately the berries spread like scarlet all over the path, for a
long distance; and the old Toad-Woman, who was almost as fond of these
berries as she was of fat bears, could not avoid stooping down to pick
and eat.

The old Toad-Woman was very anxious to get forward, but the
snakeberry-vines kept spreading out on every side; and they still grow
and grow, and spread and spread; and to this day the wicked old
Toad-Woman is busy picking the berries, and she will never be able to

the-two-jeebi,1,"There lived a hunter in the North, who had a wife and one child. His
lodge stood far off in the forest, several days' journey from any other.
He spent his days in hunting, and his evenings in relating to his wife
the incidents that had befallen him. As game was very abundant, he found
no difficulty in killing as much as they wanted. Just in all his acts,
he lived a peaceful and happy life.

One evening during the winter season, it chanced that he remained out
longer than usual, and his wife began to fear that some accident had
befallen him. It was already dark. She listened attentively, and at last
heard the sound of approaching footsteps.

Not doubting that it was her husband, she went to the door and beheld
two strange females. She bade them enter, and invited them to remain.
She observed that they were total strangers in the country. There was
something so peculiar in their looks, air and manner, that she was
disturbed by their presence. They would not come near to the fire. They
sat in a remote part of the lodge, shy and taciturn, and drew their
garments about them in such a manner as nearly to hide their faces. So
far as she could judge, they were pale, hollow-eyed, and long-visaged,
very thin and emaciated.",175,country,is capable of,arm_itself_with_weaponry,What can a country do?,It can arm itself.
the-two-jeebi,2,"There was but little light in the lodge, as the fire was low, and its
fitful flashes, by disclosing their white faces and then dropping them
in sudden darkness, served rather to increase than to dispel her fears.

""Merciful Spirit!"" cried a voice from the opposite part of the lodge;
""there are two corpses clothed with garments!""

The hunter's wife turned around, but seeing nobody save her little
child, staring across from under his blanket, she said to herself, ""The
boy can not speak; the sounds were but the gusts of wind."" She trembled,
and was ready to sink to the earth.

Her husband at this moment entered, and in some measure relieved her
alarm. He threw down the carcass of a large fat deer.

""Behold what a fine and fat animal!"" cried the mysterious females; and
they immediately ran and pulled off pieces of the whitest fat, which
they greedily devoured.",120,sink,is at location of,kitchen,Where can we see a sink?,In the kitchen.
the-two-jeebi,3,"The hunter and his wife looked on with astonishment, but remained
silent. They supposed that their guests might have been stricken with
famine.

The next day, however, the same unusual conduct was repeated. The
strange females again tore off the fat and devoured it with eagerness.
The third day, the hunter thought that he would anticipate their wants
by tying up a share of the hunt, and placing it apart for their express
use. They accepted it, but still appeared dissatisfied, and went to the
wife's portion and tore off more.

The hunter and his wife were surprised at such rude and unaccountable
conduct, but they remained silent, for they respected their guests, and
had observed that they had been attended with marked good luck during
the sojourn of these mysterious visitors in their lodge.

In other respects, the deportment of the females was strictly
unexceptionable. They were modest, distant, and silent. They never
uttered a word during the day. At night they would occupy themselves in
procuring wood, which they carried to the lodge, and then, restoring the
implements exactly where they had found them, resume their places
without speaking. They were never known to stay out until daylight. They
never laughed or jested.",106,hunter,is capable of,fire_rifle,What can a hunter do?,He can fire rifle.
the-two-jeebi,4,"The winter was nearly passed away, when, one evening, the hunter was
abroad later than usual. The moment he came in and laid down his day's
hunt, as was his custom, before his wife, the two females seized upon
the deer and began to tear off the fat in so unceremonious a way that
her anger was excited. She constrained herself, however, in a good
degree, but she could not conceal her feelings, though she said but
little.

The strange guests observed the state of her mind, and they became
uneasy, and withdrew further still into the remote gloom of the lodge.
The good hunter saw the eclipse that was darkening the quiet of his
lodge, and carefully inquired of its cause; but his wife denied having
used any words of complaining or reproach.

They retired to their couches, and the hunter tried to compose himself
to sleep, but could not, for the sighs and sobs of the two females were
incessant. He arose on his couch and addressed them as follows:

""Tell me,"" said he, ""what is it that gives you pain of mind and causes
you to bemoan your presence here. Has my wife given you offense, or
trespassed upon the rights of hospitality?""",1,winter,has property,cold,How do you feel in winter?,I feel cold.

mankind, and to try the sincerity of the living. Often we have heard the
bereaved by death say that if the lost could be restored, they would
devote their lives to make them happy. We have been moved by the bitter
lamentations which have reached the place of the departed, and have
come to make proof of the sincerity of those who have lost friends. We
are your two dead sisters. Three moons were allotted us by the Master of
Life to make the trial. More than half the time had been successfully
passed, when the angry feelings of your wife indicated the irksomeness
you felt at our presence, and has made us resolve on our departure.""

They continued to talk to the hunter and his wife, gave them
instructions as to a future life, and pronounced a blessing upon them.",173,departure,is the antonym of,arrival,What is opposite to departure?,Arrival.
the-two-jeebi,6,"""There is one point,"" they added, ""of which we wish to speak. You have
thought our conduct very strange and rude in possessing ourselves of the
choicest parts of your hunt. _That_ was the point of trial selected to
put you to. It is the wife's peculiar privilege. You love your wife. For
another to usurp what belongs to her, we know to be the severest test of
her goodness of heart, and consequently of your temper and feelings. We
knew your manners and customs, but we came to prove you, not by
complying with but by violating them. Pardon us. We are the agents of
him who sent us. Peace to your dwelling. Farewell!""

When they ceased, total darkness filled the lodge. No object could be
seen. The inmates heard the lodge-door open and shut, but they never saw
more of the Two Spirits.

The hunter found the success which they had promised. He became
celebrated in the chase, and never wanted for any thing. He had many
children, all of whom grew up to manhood; and he who had lain in the
lodge, a little child, while the Jeebi dwelt there, led them in all good

""You're precious ugly,"" said the wild-ducks; ""but that doesn't matter to us as long as you don't marry into our family."" Poor wretch! He wasn't thinking much about marrying, as long as he could be allowed to lie among the reeds, and drink a little marsh water. There he lay two whole days, and then came a pair of wild geese (or rather wild ganders, for they were both he's): they hadn't been hatched out very long, and so they were particularly lively. ""Here, mate,"" they said, ""you're so ugly I quite like you. Will you come along and be a migrant?

Another bang! bang! and whole flights of geese flew up from the reeds, and there was yet another bang! a great shoot was afoot. The sportsmen were all round the marsh, some even sitting up among the branches of trees that stretched out over the reeds. The blue smoke drifted like clouds, in among the dark stems, and hung far out over the water. The dogs went splash! splash! into the mud, and the reeds and rushes swayed hither and thither; it was terrible for the wretched Duckling, who was bending his neck to get it under his wing, when all at once, close to him, there was a fearful big dog with his tongue hanging right out of his mouth and his eyes shining horribly.

But there he lay perfectly still while the duck shots rattled in the reeds and gun after gun banged out. It was well on in the day before all was quiet, but the unhappy bird dared not get up even then. He waited several hours yet, before he looked about him, and then he hurried away from the marsh as fast as ever he could, running over fields and meadows, and such a wind got up that he had hard work to get along. Towards evening he was near a poor little cottage, so crazy was it that it didn't know which way to tumble down, so it remained standing. The wind howled so fiercely round the Duckling that he had to sit down on his tail to keep facing it, and it grew worse and worse.

And the Cat said: ""Can you put up your fur, or purr, or give out sparks? No! Then you've no call to have an opinion when sensible people are talking.""

So the Duckling lay in a corner and was in the lowest spirits. He began to think of the fresh air and sunshine, and such a strange longing to swim in the water came on him that he could not help telling the Hen.

""What's the matter with you?"" she asked. ""You've nothing to do, that's why you get these fancies; you just lay some eggs, or purr, and they'll pass off."" ""But it is so delicious to float on the water,"" said the Duckling; ""so lovely to get it over your head and dive right down to the bottom.""

""Oh yes, most delightful, of course!"" said the Hen. ""Why, you're absolutely mad! Ask the Cat--he's the cleverest man I know--whether he enjoys floating on the water or diving down; I say nothing of myself.

Don't give yourself airs, child, but thank your Maker for all the kindness people have done you. Don't you live in a warm room among company you can learn something from? But there! You're a rubbishy thing, and there's little entertainment in your company. You may take it from me! I mean well by you, and I'm telling you home truths, and that's how people can see their true friends. Now just do take pains to lay eggs, or learn to purr or else give sparks.""

They were brilliantly white, with long supple necks. They were swans, and they uttered a strange sound and spread their splendid long wings and flew far away from the cold region to warmer lands, and unfrozen lakes. They mounted so high, so high that the ugly little Duckling was strangely moved; he whirled himself round in the water like a wheel, he stretched his neck straight up into the air after them and uttered such a loud cry, so strange, that he was quite frightened at it himself. Oh, he could not forget those beautiful birds, those wonderful birds! And the moment they were out of sight he dived right down to the bottom of the water, and when he came up again he was almost beside himself. He didn't know what the birds were called or which way they were flying, but he loved them as he had never loved anything yet.

The woman screamed and threw up her hands. Then he flew into the butter-tub and after that into the meal-bin and out again. Goodness, what a sight he was! The woman screamed out and hit at him with the tongs, and the children tumbled over one another trying to catch him, laughing, calling out--by good luck the door stood open, and out he rushed into the bushes, on the new fallen snow, and there he lay almost in a swoon.",73,milk,has property,white,What color is mllk?,Milk is usually white.

When the sun began once more to shine out warm and the larks to sing, he was lying among the reeds in the marsh, and it was the beautiful spring. Then all at once he lifted his wings, and they rustled more strongly than before, and bore him swiftly away; and before he knew it he was in a spacious garden where were apple trees in blossom, and sweet-smelling lilacs hung on long green boughs right down to the winding moat. Oh, it was lovely here, and fresh with spring; and straight in front of him, out of the shadows, came three beautiful white swans with rustling plumage floating lightly on the water.

This son's name was Uraschimataro, which means in Japanese, 'Son of the island,' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman, minding neither wind nor weather. Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro, and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents, 'If your son goes on being so rash, one day he will try his luck once too often, and the waves will end by swallowing him up.'

'After all,' it said, 'what good can I do you? I am so young and small, and I would so gladly live a little longer. Be merciful and set me free, and I shall know how to prove my gratitude.'

Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured, and besides, he could never bear to say no, so he picked up the turtle, and put it back into the sea.",51,turtle,is capable of,live_long_time,What do we know about turtles?,They can live for a long time.

But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks, there arose a fierce whirlwind, which shattered his boat to pieces, and she was sucked under by the waves. Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate. But he was a powerful swimmer, and struggled hard to reach the shore. Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him, and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said: 'I am the turtle whose life you once saved. I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude. The land is still far distant, and without my help you would never get there. Climb on my back, and I will take you where you will.' Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice, and thankfully accepted his friend's help.

Oh, how quickly they darted through the still, warm sea! The young man held tight, and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel, but for three days they rushed on, till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace, shining with gold and silver, crystal and precious stones, and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls. But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside, he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within, which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales.

'Where have you brought me?' he asked his guide in a low voice.

And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him, and she begged him to stay with her, and in return promised that he should never grow old, neither should his beauty fade.

He fought against it hard, knowing how it would grieve the princess, but it grew on him stronger and stronger, till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong. Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home, and that he must see his parents once more. The princess was almost frozen with horror, and implored him to stay with her, or something dreadful would be sure to happen. 'You will never come back, and we shall meet again no more,' she moaned bitterly. But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated, 'Only this once will I leave you, and then will I return to your side for ever.'

Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box, and gave it to Uraschimataro, praying him to keep it carefully, and above all things never to open it. 'If you can do this,' she said as she bade him farewell, 'your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore, and will carry you back to me.'

Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart, and swore solemnly to do her bidding. He hid the box safely in his garments, seated himself on the back of the turtle, and vanished in the ocean path, waving his hand to the princess.

the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,8,"Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps. He saw the smoke curling through the roof, and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted. He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. After all, everything was changed. Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. Quickly he saw his old home; yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them.

Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. And he was right. In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by.

Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street, hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old.

He might be the victim of some enchanter's spell, and in his hand lay the counter-charm. Almost unconsciously he opened it, and a purple vapour came pouring out. He held the empty box in his hand, and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled, like the hand of an old, old man. He ran to the brook, which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain. and saw himself reflected as in a mirror. It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him. Wounded to death, he crept back through the village, and no man knew the old, old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before. So he toiled wearily back, till he reached the shore, and here he sat sadly on a rock, and called loudly on the turtle. But she never came back any more, but instead, death came soon, and set him free. But before that happened, the people who saw him sitting lonely on the shore had heard his story, and when their children were restless they used to tell them of the good son who from love to his parents had given up for their sakes the splendour and wonders of the palace in the sea, and the most beautiful woman in the world besides.",30,victim,is a,person,What is a victim?,A victim is a person who suffers from crimes.

boar, and, spitting with terror, she scrambled up into the fork of the
tree, and as it happened right into the bear's face. Now it was the
bear's turn to be alarmed, and with a mighty growl he jumped down from
the oak and fell right on the top of the wolf and killed him as dead as
a stone.

On their way home from the war the fox caught score of mice, and when
they reached Simon's cottage he put them all on the stove and said to

old cat would ever catch another mouse.'

But Susan answered, 'There, you see, I always said our cat was a most
excellent creature--but you men always think you know best.'

He journeyed from day to day, not knowing where he was going, until at last, just at nightfall, he reached a great, gloomy forest. He did not know his way, and, to make matters worse, it began to thunder, and the rain poured down. He took the first path he could find, and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light, and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night. At length, guided by the light, he reached the door of the most splendid castle he could have imagined. This door was of gold covered with carbuncles, and it was the pure red light which shone from them that had shown him the way through the forest. The walls were of the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors, and the Prince saw that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them; but as he was terribly wet, and the rain still fell in torrents, he could not stay to look about any more, but came back to the golden door.

He was so much surprised that he stood quite still, until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands, so that, though he was somewhat uneasy, he could not help going on. With his hand on his sword, to be prepared for whatever might happen, he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli, while two lovely voices sang:

After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped, and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner; at the same moment the fire lighted itself, and the pretty, soft, clever hands took off the Prince's wet, muddy clothes, and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs, all embroidered with gold and emeralds.

The table was laid for supper with two golden plates, and golden spoons and forks, and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones. The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for, when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music, who took their places at one end of the room, and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key, and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars, making the strangest kind of music that could be heard.

the-white-cat,11,"The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming, but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil, and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine. She looked very young and very sad, and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the Prince:

""King's son, you are welcome; the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you.""

""Lady Cat,"" replied the Prince, ""I thank you for receiving me so kindly, but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat? Indeed, the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly.""

""King's son,"" said the White Cat, ""I beg you to spare me these compliments, for I am not used to them.

the-white-cat,12,"So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper, and first they put on the table two dishes, one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice. The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all; but the White Cat, seeing this, assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen, and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice; and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning. Presently he noticed that on the little paw that was next him the White Cat wore a bracelet containing a portrait, and he begged to be allowed to look at it. To his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man, who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait! The White Cat sighed as he looked at it, and seemed sadder than ever, and the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her; so he began to talk about other things, and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself, and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world.",66,dish,is used for,hold_food,What can dishes do?,To hold food.

The Prince went to bed in silence, as he did not quite know how to begin a conversation with the hands that waited on him, and in the morning he was awakened by a noise and confusion outside of his window, and the hands came and quickly dressed him in hunting costume. When he looked out all the cats were assembled in the courtyard, some leading greyhounds, some blowing horns, for the White Cat was going out hunting. The hands led a wooden horse up to the Prince, and seemed to expect him to mount it, at which he was very indignant; but it was no use for him to object, for he speedily found himself upon its back, and it pranced gaily off with him.",57,wing,is used for,flying,What is the organ used for flying?,The wing.
the-white-cat,14,"The White Cat herself was riding a monkey, which climbed even up to the eagles' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets. Never was there a pleasanter hunting party, and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before, but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet, which must have contained a magic draught, for, as soon as he had swallowed its contents, he forgot everything, even the little dog that he was seeking for the King, and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat! And so the days passed, in every kind of amusement, until the year was nearly gone. The Prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers: he did not even know what country he belonged to; but the White Cat knew when he ought to go back, and one day she said to him:

""Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father, and your brothers have found lovely ones?""",7,monkey,desires,eat_banana,What do monkeys like to eat?,They like eating bananas.

""What can have made me forget such an important thing? My whole fortune depends upon it; and even if I could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom, where should I find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days?"" And he began to be very vexed. But the White Cat said to him: ""King's son, do not trouble yourself; I am your friend, and will make everything easy for you. You can still stay here for a day, as the good wooden horse can take you to your country in twelve hours.""

""I thank you, beautiful Cat,"" said the Prince; ""but what good will it do me to get back if I have not a dog to take to my father?""

""See here,"" answered the White Cat, holding up an acorn; ""there is a prettier one in this than in the Dogstar!""

""Oh! White Cat dear,"" said the Prince, ""how unkind you are to laugh at me now!""

""Only listen,"" she said, holding the acorn to his ear.

the-white-cat,20,"The Prince met them joyfully, and they began to tell him all their adventures; but he managed to hide from them what he had been doing, and even led them to think that a turnspit dog which he had with him was the one he was bringing for the King. Fond as they all were of one another, the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs certainly had a better chance. The next morning they started in the same chariot. The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny, fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them. As for the turnspit, he ran after the chariot, and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all. When they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the King's great hall; and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier. They were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally, when the youngest stepped forward, drawing from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him. He opened it quickly, and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring. The Prince laid it upon the ground, and it got up at once and began to dance. The King did not know what to say, for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature.",14,adventure,is a,new_and_exciting,What is the encountering of new and exciting risks?,Adventure.
the-white-cat,21,"Nevertheless, as he was in no hurry to part with his crown, he told his sons that, as they had been so successful the first time, he would ask them to go once again, and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle. The brothers were not very willing to set out again, but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance, and they started as before. The youngest again mounted the wooden horse, and rode back at full speed to his beloved White Cat. Every door of the castle stood wide open, and every window and turret was illuminated, so it looked more wonderful than before. The hands hastened to meet him, and led the wooden horse off to the stable, while he hurried in to find the White Cat.

And then he stroked and petted her, and told her of his successful journey, and how he had come back to ask her help, as he believed that it was impossible to find what the King demanded.

the-white-cat,23,"And then the hands appeared carrying torches, and conducted the Prince and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river, from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts; after which they had supper, which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks, for it was very late, and he was hungry after his long ride. And so the days passed quickly as before; it was impossible to feel dull with the White Cat, and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements-indeed, she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be. But when the Prince asked her how it was that she was so wise, she only said:

""King's son, do not ask me; guess what you please. I may not tell you anything.""",6,torch,is capable of,light_way,What can torches do?,Torches can light the way.
the-white-cat,24,"The Prince was so happy that he did not trouble himself at all about the time, but presently the White Cat told him that the year was gone, and that he need not be at all anxious about the piece of muslin, as they had made it very well.

""This time,"" she added, ""I can give you a suitable escort""; and on looking out into the courtyard the Prince saw a superb chariot of burnished gold, enameled in flame color with a thousand different devices. It was drawn by twelve snow-white horses, harnessed four abreast; their trappings were flame-colored velvet, embroidered with diamonds. A hundred chariots followed, each drawn by eight horses, and filled with officers in splendid uniforms, and a thousand guards surrounded the procession. ""Go!"" said the White Cat, ""and when you appear before the King in such state he surely will not refuse you the crown which you deserve. Take this walnut, but do not open it until you are before him, then you will find in it the piece of stuff you asked me for.""

""Lovely Blanchette,"" said the Prince, ""how can I thank you properly for all your kindness to me? Only tell me that you wish it, and I will give up for ever all thought of being king, and will stay here with you always.""

the-white-cat,25,"So the Prince kissed her little paw and set out. You can imagine how fast he traveled when I tell you that they reached the King's palace in just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there. This time the Prince was so late that he did not try to meet his brothers at their castle, so they thought he could not be coming, and were rather glad of it, and displayed their pieces of muslin to the King proudly, feeling sure of success. And indeed the stuff was very fine, and would go through the eye of a very large needle; but the King, who was only too glad to make a difficulty, sent for a particular needle, which was kept among the Crown jewels, and had such a small eye that everybody saw at once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it. The Princes were angry, and were beginning to complain that it was a trick, when suddenly the trumpets sounded and the youngest Prince came in. His father and brothers were quite astonished at his magnificence, and after he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it, fully expecting to find the piece of muslin, but instead there was only a hazel-nut.

the-white-cat,27,"In an instant he felt a cat's claw give his hand quite a sharp scratch, and hoping that it was meant as an encouragement he opened the millet seed, and drew out of it a piece of muslin four hundred ells long, woven with the loveliest colors and most wonderful patterns; and when the needle was brought it went through the eye six times with the greatest ease! The King turned pale, and the other Princes stood silent and sorrowful, for nobody could deny that this was the most marvelous piece of muslin that was to be found in the world.",82,prince,is a,son_of_king,Who is the son of king?,Prince.

The Prince considered that he had earned the kingdom fairly twice over but still he was too well bred to argue about it, so he just went back to his gorgeous chariot, and, surrounded by his escort, returned to the White Cat faster than he had come. This time she was expecting him, the path was strewn with flowers, and a thousand braziers were burning scented woods which perfumed the air. Seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival, the White Cat waited for him. ""Well, King's son,"" she said, ""here you are once more, without a crown.""

But nothing he could say altered her determination, and at last he drew his sword, and desperately, with a trembling hand, cut off the little white head. But imagine his astonishment and delight when suddenly a lovely princess stood before him, and, while he was still speechless with amazement, the door opened and a goodly company of knights and ladies entered, each carrying a cat's skin! They hastened with every sign of joy to the Princess, kissing her hand and congratulating her on being once more restored to her natural shape. She received them graciously, but after a few minutes begged that they would leave her alone with the Prince, to whom she said:

""You see, Prince, that you were right in supposing me to be no ordinary cat. My father reigned over six kingdoms. The Queen, my mother, whom he loved dearly, had a passion for traveling and exploring, and when I was only a few weeks old she obtained his permission to visit a certain mountain of which she had heard many marvelous tales, and set out, taking with her a number of her attendants.

Now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit, the more the Queen was determined that have it she would. So she ordered that they should bring ladders, and get over the wall into the garden; but though the wall did not look very high, and they tied the ladders together to make them very long, it was quite impossible to get to the top.",118,ladder,is used for,climbing_walls,What is ladder used for doing?,Climbing walls.

In the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened, and saw to her surprise a tiny, ugly old woman seated by her bedside, who said to her:

'I must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your Majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit; but to save you annoyance, my sisters and I will consent to give you as much as you can carry away, on one condition-that is, that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own.'

'Ah! my dear madam,' cried the Queen, 'is there nothing else that you will take for the fruit? I will give you my kingdoms willingly.'

'No,' replied the old fairy, 'we will have nothing but your little daughter. She shall be as happy as the day is long, and we will give her everything that is worth having in fairy-land, but you must not see her again until she is married.'

'Though it is a hard condition,' said the Queen, 'I consent, for I shall certainly die if I do not taste the fruit, and so I should lose my little daughter either way.'",88,fruit,is at location of,refridgerator,Where should fruit be stored?,In the refrigerator.

'Will you gather the fruit yourself, Queen?' said the old fairy, 'or shall I call it to come to you?'

'I beg you to let me see it come when it is called,' cried the Queen; 'that will be something quite new.' The old fairy whistled twice, then she cried:

'Apricots, peaches, nectarines, cherries, plums, pears, melons, grapes, apples, oranges, lemons, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, come!'

This time they came themselves to fetch me, in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses, followed by the dragon, who was led with chains of diamonds. My cradle was placed between the old fairies, who loaded me with caresses, and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me. There I grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare, and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess, but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog, who could both talk; and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies, who came mounted upon the dragon.",193,parrot,is a,beautiful_bird,What is a parrot?,"A kind of beautiful bird, many species of which are colorful and able to mimic human speech."

When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference. You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one new to talk to, and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell, then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell. But after that he came again many times and at last I consented to marry him, but the question was how was I to escape from my tower. The fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning, and by great diligence I made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to the foot of the tower; but, alas! just as my prince was helping me to descend it, the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in.",30,prison,is used for,confining_prisoners,What are prisons used for doing?,Confining prisoners.

When they brought me here I found all the lords and ladies of my father's court awaiting me under the same enchantment, while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible, all but their hands.

As they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my history, for until then I had quite believed that I was their child, and warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover.

""And you have won it, lovely Princess,"" interrupted the Prince.

""You are indeed wonderfully like him,"" resumed the Princess-""in voice, in features, and everything; and if you really love me all my troubles will be at an end.""

""And mine too,"" cried the Prince, throwing himself at her feet, ""if you will consent to marry me.""

And then they set out together for the town. Each prince and princess rode in a splendid carriage; the horses were decked with plumes of feathers, and glittered with gold.

she knew up in the mountains, so that he might learn to go out in all
weathers, and bear heat and cold, and grow tall and strong. Kilweh was
quite happy with his nurse, and ran races and climbed hills with the

'Never again shall I rise from this bed, and by and bye thou wilt take
another wife. But lest she should make thee forget thy son, I charge
thee that thou take not a wife until thou see a briar with two blossoms
upon my grave.' And this he promised her. Then she further bade him
to see to her grave that nothing might grow thereon. This likewise he

found one. But he did not tell her about his son; indeed he hardly
remembered that he had one till she heard it at last from an old woman

forgotten something he had been bidden to do, and Kilweh blushed red as
he answered:

'Well, open the portal, I say.'

'No, that I may not do, for none can enter save the son of a king or a
pedlar who has goods to sell. But elsewhere there will be food for thy
dogs and hay for thy horse, and for thee collops cooked and peppered,
and sweet wine shall be served in the guest chamber.'

'That will not do for me,' answered Kilweh. 'If thou wilt not open the
gate I will send up three shouts that shall be heard from Cornwall unto
the north, and yet again to Ireland.'

to him who now stands at the door.'

'If walking you did enter here, return you running,' replied Arthur,
'and let everyone that opens and shuts the eye show him respect and
serve him, for it is not meet to keep such a man in the wind and rain.'
So Glewlwyd unbarred the gate and Kilweh rode in upon his charger.

'I am Kilweh, son of Kilydd,' replied the youth.

'Then my cousin you are in truth,' replied Arthur, 'and whatever boon
you may ask you shall receive.'

'The boon I crave is that you may win for me Olwen, the daughter of

hear the ant leave her nest fifty miles away: from these and from Kai

would could pass nine nights without sleep, and nine days beneath the
water--that answered him:

paths in a land where he had never been as surely as he did those of
his own country; there was Gwrhyr, that could speak all tongues; and
Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, who never returned till he had gained what
he sought; and last of all there was Menw, who could weave a spell over
them so that none might see them, while they could see everyone.

So these seven journeyed together till they reached a vast open plain in
which was a fair castle. But though it seemed so close it was not until
the evening of the third day that they really drew near to it, and in
front of it a flock of sheep was spread, so many in number that there
seemed no end to them. A shepherd stood on a mound watching over them,

'I am called Custennin, brother of Yspaddaden, and ill has he treated
me. And who are you, and what do you here?'

'We come from Arthur the king, to seek Olwen the daughter of
Yspaddaden,' but at this news the shepherd gave a cry:

'O men, be warned and turn back while there is yet time. Others have
gone on that quest, but none have escaped to tell the tale,' and he rose
to his feet as if to leave them. Then Kilweh held out to him a ring of
gold, and he tried to put it on his finger, but it was too small, so he
placed it in his glove, and went home and gave it to his wife.",167,small,is a,opposite_of_big,What is opposite to small?,BIg.

Arthur, and he has come to seek Olwen.' And when the wife heard that she
knew that Kilweh was her nephew, and her heart yearned after him, half
with joy at the thought of seeing him, and half with sorrow for the doom
she feared.

Soon they heard steps approaching, and Kai and the rest entered into the

answered:

'Let him come with me and be my comrade, and he shall never be slain

'What is your errand here?' asked the woman.

'We seek Olwen the maiden for this youth,' answered Kai; 'does she ever

'We pledge it,' said they, and the maiden came.

A fair sight was she in a robe of flame-coloured silk, with a collar of
ruddy gold about her neck, bright with emeralds and rubies. More yellow
was her head than the flower of the broom, and her skin was whiter than

not to go without his knowledge, for his life will only last till I am
betrothed. Whatever is, must be, but this counsel I will give you. Go,
and ask me of my father, and whatsoever he shall required of you grant

'Come hither to-morrow and I will answer you,' replied Yspaddaden
Penkawr, and as they rose to leave the hall he caught up one of the
three poisoned darts that lay beside him and flung it in their midst.
But Bedwyr saw and caught it, and flung it back so hard that it pierced
the knee of Yspaddaden.

'Be it so; we will go to meat,' but as they turned he took up the second
dart that lay by his side and cast it after them. And Menw caught it,
and flung it at him, and wounded him in the chest, so that it came out
at his back.

'Your work is good; I am content.'

Then said Kai:

'It is your scabbard that has rusted thy sword; give it to me that I may
take out the wooden sides of it and put in new ones.' And he took the
scabbard in one hand and the sword in the other, and came and stood
behind the giant, as if he would have sheathed the sword in the

when three nights old from between his mother and the wall.'

anvil in this place. But from that time no work has been done upon it,
save that every evening I have pecked at it, till now there is not so

before them, as fast as his old wings would carry him, till he reached
the eagle of Gwern Abbey, but when they inquired of the eagle whether he

'When I first came hither,' said the eagle, 'there was a rock here, and
every evening I pecked at the stars from the top of it. Now, behold, it
is not even a span high! But only once have I heard of the man you

swooped down upon a salmon, and struck my claws into him, but he drew me
down under water till scarcely could I escape him. Then I summoned all

from Arthur to inquire if thou knowest aught concerning Mabon the son of
Modron.' And the salmon answered:

'As much as I know I will tell thee. With every tide I go up the river,
till I reach the walls of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong
as I never found elsewhere. And that you may see that what I say is true

Mabon. And he now being free returned home with Arthur.

After this, on a certain day, as Gwythyr was walking across a mountain
he heard a grievous cry, and he hastened towards it. In a little valley
he saw the heather burning and the fire spreading fast towards the
anthill, and all the ants were hurrying to and fro, not knowing whither
to go. Gwythyr had pity on them, and put out the fire, and in gratitude
the ants brought him the nine bushels of flax seed which Yspaddaden
Penkawr required of Kilweh. And many of the other marvels were done
likewise by Arthur and his knights, and at last it came to the fight
with Trwyth the board, to obtain the comb and the scissors and the razor

hold of the comb he had shaken them all off, and neither man nor horse
nor dog could reach him till he came to Cornwall, whither Arthur had
sworn he should not go. Thither Arthur followed after him with his
knights, and if it had been hard to win the razor and the scissors, the

shaved by Kaw.

'Is your daughter mine now?' asked Kilweh.

three-lemons,5,"Mike by the Stove thought that things were going from bad to worse, and
this was the truth, since the further he went the warmer it grew. The
part of the country in which he was traveling was so parched and dried
that not a drop of water was to be found, and he was half-dead with
thirst. For a long time he hesitated before biting into the last lemon;
but at last there was nothing else left to do. When he had bitten
into it, a princess looked out: she was the most beautiful in twelve
kingdoms, and she cried that if she could have no water, she must die on
the spot. Mike by the Stove ran about and looked for water, and this
time he met the king's miller, who showed him the way to the mill-pond.
When he had come with her to the mill-pond, and had given her water, she
came completely out of the lemon. But she had nothing to wear, and Mike
by the Stove had to give her his smock. She put it on, and hid in a
tree; while he was to go to the castle and bring her clothes, and tell

said she, and threw away the water-pail. And then she suddenly noticed
that the face in the water was that of the princess who sat in the tree.
This made her so angry that she pulled her down from the tree, and threw
her into the pond. Then she herself put on Mike by the Stove's smock,
and climbed into the tree. When the king arrived, and saw the swart,
homely kitchen-maid, he grew red and white in turn; but when he heard
the people say she was the greatest beauty in twelve kingdoms, he had to
believe, willy-nilly, that there was something in it, and he did not
want to be unjust to Mike by the Stove, who had taken so much trouble to
find her. She might grow more beautiful in time, thought he, if she were
adorned with jewels, and dressed in fine clothes, and so he took her
home with him. Then they sent for wig-makers and seamstresses, and she
was adorned and dressed like a princess; but for all their washing and

happened, that the cook had thrown her into the pond, and that she had
been the silver fish, the lump of silver, and the linden-tree, and the
sticks of wood, and that she was the true princess. It was hard to get
at the king, for the swart, homely cook was with him early and late; but
at last they decided to tell him that a declaration of war had come
from a neighboring monarch, and so they got him out. When he saw the
beautiful princess, he fell so deeply in love with her that he wanted to
marry her out of hand, and when he heard how badly the swart, homely

'My boy,' he said, 'you have not got quite as much sense as other people, but if Heaven has deprived you of some of your wits, it was given you a kind heart. Always listen to what it says, and take heed to the words of your mother and brothers, as well as you are able!' So saying the old man sank back on his pillows and died.

The cries of grief uttered by Martin and Michael sounded through the house, but Jack remained by the bedside of his father, still and silent, as if he were dead also.

Jack would have liked nothing better than to sit and dream by the fire, but the mother, who was very old herself, declared that there was no work for him to do, and that he must seek it with his brothers.

So, one fine morning, all three set out; Martin and Michael carried two great bags full of food, but Jack carried nothing. This made his brothers very angry, for the day was hot and the bags were heavy, and about noon they sat down under a tree and began to eat. Jack was as hungry as they were, but he knew that it was no use asking for anything; and he threw himself under another tree, and wept bitterly.",123,heavy,is the antonym of,light,What is the antonym of light?,Heavy.

'You are a nice pair! You talk of seeking your fortunes so as not to be a burden on our mother, and you begin by carrying off all the food she has in the house!'

Martin thanked him, but being very proud, explained that it was only shelter they wanted, as they had plenty of food with them; and he and Michael at once opened their bags and began to eat, while Jack hid himself in a corner. The wife, on seeing this, took pity on him, and called him to come and share their supper, which he gladly did, and very good he found it. At this, Martin regretted deeply that he had been so foolish as to refuse, for his bits of bread and cheese seemed very hard when he smelt the savoury soup his brother was enjoying.

'We must have taken a wrong turning! Let us go back.'

'Idiot!' replied Michael, who was hungry too, and, like many people when they are hungry, very cross also. 'We set out to travel through the world, and what does it matter if we go to the right or to the left?' And, without another word, took the path to the castle, closely followed by Jack, and after a moment by Martin likewise.",129,path,is a,way,What is a path?,A way for pedestrians.

Not a creature was to be seen, and suddenly Martin-he did not know why-felt a little frightened. He would have left the castle at once, but stopped when Jack boldly walked up to a door in the wall and opened it. He could not for very shame be outdone by his younger brother, and passed behind him into another splendid hall, which was filled from floor to ceiling with great pieces of copper money.

The sight quite dazzled Martin and Michael, who emptied all the provisions that remained out of their bags, and heaped them up instead with handfuls of copper.",104,dazzle,is a,brightness,What is dazzle?,To confuse the sight with brightness.

In an instant his brothers had turned their bags upside down, so that the copper money tumbled out on to the floor, and were shovelling in handfuls of the silver instead. They had hardly finished, when Jack opened yet a third door, and all three fell back in amazement, for this room as a mass of gold, so bright that their eyes grew sore as they looked at it. However, they soon recovered from their surprise, and quickly emptied their bags of silver, and filled them with gold instead. When they would hold no more, Martin said:

'We had better hurry off now lest somebody else should come, and we might not know what to do'; and, followed by Michael, he hastily left the castle. Jack lingered behind for a few minutes to put pieces of gold, silver, and copper into his pocket, and to eat the food that his brothers had thrown down in the first room. Then he went after them, and found them lying down to rest in the midst of a forest. It was near sunset, and Martin began to feel hungry, so, when Jack arrived, he bade him return to the castle and bring the bread and cheese that they had left there.",256,cheese,is made of,milk,What is cheese made from?,Milk.

At this reply both brothers were beside themselves with anger, and fell upon the boy, beating him, and calling him names, till they were quite tired.

'Go where you like,' cried Martin with a final kick; 'but never come near us again.' And poor Jack ran weeping into the woods.

At length he made up his mind to go to the caste and take away as much money with him as would enable him to live in comfort for the rest of his life. This being decided, he sprang up, and set out along the path which led to the castle. As before, the door stood open, and he went on till he had reached the hall of gold, and there he took off his jacket and tied the sleeves together so that it might make a kind of bag. He then began to pour in the gold by handfuls, when, all at once, a noise like thunder shook the castle. This was followed by a voice, hoarse as that of a bull, which cried:

'I smell the smell of a man.' And two giants entered.",71,comfort,is a,good_feeling,What is comfort?,The good feeling of contentment and ease.

'To please my friend I will spare your life on condition that, for the future, you shall guard our treasures. If you are hungry take this little table and rap on it, saying, as you do so: ""The dinner of an emperor!"" and you will get as much food as you want.'

With a light heart Jack promised all that was asked of him, and for some days enjoyed himself mightily. He had everything he could wish for, and did nothing from morning till night; but by-and-by he began to get very tired of it all.",51,whisper,is a,speaking,Which act of speaking is in a low voice?,Whisper.
three-treasures-of-giants,13,"'Let the giants guard their treasures themselves,' he said to himself at last; 'I am going away. But I will leave all the gold and silver behind me, and will take nought but you, my good little table.'

So, tucking the table under his arm, he started off for the forest, but he did not linger there long, and soon found himself in the fields on the other side. There he saw an old man, who begged Jack to give him something to eat.

'You could not have asked a better person,' answered Jack cheerfully. And signing to him to sit down with him under a tree, he set the table in front of them, and struck it three times, crying:

'The dinner of an emperor!' He had hardly uttered the words when fish and meat of all kinds appeared on it!",142,cry,has subevent,shed_tears,What do people do when they cry?,They shed tears.

Do you see this cornet? Well, you have only to tell it that you wish for an army, and you will have as many soldiers as you require.'

Now, since he had been left to himself, Jack had grown ambitious, so, after a moment's hesitation, he took the cornet and gave the table in exchange. The old man bade him farewell, and set off down one path, while Jack chose another, and for a long time he was quite pleased with his new possession. Then, as he felt hungry, he wished for his table back again, as no house was in sight, and he wanted some supper badly.

'A mile or two along that road,' answered Jack, 'you will find an old man carrying a table. Take the table from him and bring it to me.'

The officer saluted and went back to his men, who started at a gallop to do Jack's bidding.

In ten minutes they had returned, bearing the table with them.

'That is all, thank you,' said Jack; and the soldiers disappeared inside the cornet.",33,approach,has subevent,come,What is approach?,To come near.

'Certainly, you shall have something to eat,' replied Jack. And, placing the table on the ground he cried:

'The dinner of an emperor!' when all sorts of food dishes appeared. At first the old man ate quite greedily, and said nothing; but, after his hunger was satisfied, he turned to Jack and said:

'That is a very clever trick of yours. Give the table to me and you shall have something still better.'

'I don't believe that there is anything better,' answered Jack.

'Yes, there is. Here is my bag; it will give you as many castles as you can possibly want.'",19,mean,causes,hurt_else,What may a mean person do?,They may hurt someone else's feelings.
three-treasures-of-giants,17,"Jack thought for a moment; then he replied: 'Very well, I will exchange with you.' And passing the table to the old man, he hung the bag over his arm.

Five minutes later he summoned five hundred lancers out of the cornet and bade them go after the old man and fetch back the table.

Now that by his cunning he had obtained possession of the three magic objects, he resolved to return to his native place. Smearing his face with dirt, and tearing his clothes so as to look like a beggar, he stopped the passers by and, on pretence of seeking money or food, he questioned them about the village gossip. In this manner he learned that his brothers had become great men, much respected in all the country round. When he heard that, he lost no time in going to the door of their fine house and imploring them to give him food and shelter; but the only thing he got was hard words, and a command to beg elsewhere. At length, however, at their mother's entreaty, he was told that he might pass the night in the stable. Here he waited until everybody in the house was sound asleep, when he drew his bag from under his cloak, and desired that a castle might appear in that place; and the cornet gave him soldiers to guard the castle, while the table furnished him with a good supper. In the morning, he caused it all to vanish, and when his brothers entered the stable they found him lying on the straw.",70,obtain,has subevent,get,What is obtain?,To get possession of something.
three-treasures-of-giants,18,"Jack remained here for many days, doing nothing, and-as far as anybody knew-eating nothing. This conduct puzzled his brothers greatly, and they put such constant questions to him, that at length he told them the secret of the table, and even gave a dinner to them, which far outdid any they had ever seen or heard of. But though they had solemnly promised to reveal nothing, somehow or other the tale leaked out, and before long reached the ears of the king himself. That very evening his chamberlain arrived at Jack's dwelling, with a request from the king that he might borrow the table for three days.

'Very well,' answered Jack, 'you can take it back with you. But tell his majesty that if he does not return it at the end of the three days I will make war upon him.'

So the chamberlain carried away the table and took it straight to the king, telling him at the same time of Jack's threat, at which they both laughed till their sides ached.",196,ache,is a,pain,What is ache?,To suffer pain.
three-treasures-of-giants,19,"Now the king was so delighted with the table, and the dinners it gave him, that when the three days were over he could not make up his mind to part with it. Instead, he sent for his carpenter, and bade him copy it exactly, and when it was done he told his chamberlain to return it to Jack with his best thanks. It happened to be dinner time, and Jack invited the chamberlain, who knew nothing of the trick, to stay and dine with him. The good man, who had eaten several excellent meals provided by the table in the last three days, accepted the invitation with pleasure, even though he was to dine in a stable, and sat down on the straw beside Jack.

'The dinner of an emperor!' cried Jack. But not even a morsel of cheese made its appearance.

'The dinner of an emperor!' shouted Jack in a voice of thunder. Then the truth dawned on him; and, crushing the table between his hands, he turned to the chamberlain, who, bewildered and half-frightened, was wondering how to get away.",187,crush,is a,compression,What is a crush?,A violent collision or compression.

The chamberlain hastened back to the palace, and gave the king Jack's message, at which he laughed more than before, and called all his courtiers to hear the story. But they were not quite so merry when they woke next morning and beheld ten thousand horsemen, and as many archers, surrounding the palace. The king saw it was useless to hold out, and he took the white flag of truce in one hand, and the real table in the other, and set out to look for Jack.

'I committed a crime,' said he; 'but I will do my best to make up for it. Here is your table, which I own with shame that I tried to steal, and you shall have besides, my daughter as your wife!'",2,FALSE,is the antonym of,TRUE,What is the opposite of true?,False.
three-treasures-of-giants,21,"There was no need to delay the marriage when the table was able to furnish the most splendid banquet that ever was seen, and after everyone had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted, Jack took his bag and commanded a castle filled with all sorts of treasures to arise in the park for himself and his bride.

At this proof of his power the king's heart died within him.

'Your magic is greater than mine,' he said; 'and you are young and strong, while I am old and tired. Take, therefore, the sceptre from my hand, and my crown from my head, and rule my people better than I have done.'",64,proof,is used for,showing_true,What do we use proof for?,Showing true things.

He could not hope to be more than king, and as long as he had his cornet to provide him with soldiers he was secure against his enemies. He never forgave his brothers for the way they had treated him, though he presented his mother with a beautiful castle, and everything she could possibly wish for. In the centre of his own palace was a treasure chamber, and in this chamber the table, the cornet, and the bag were kept as the most prized of all his possessions, and not a week passed without a visit from king John to make sure they were safe.

Thumbelina had to spin all day long, and every evening the mole visited her, and told her that when the summer was over the sun would not shine so hot; now it was burning the earth as hard as a stone. Yes, when the summer had passed, they would keep the wedding.

But she was not at all pleased about it, for she did not like the stupid mole. Every morning when the sun was rising, and every evening when it was setting, she would steal out of the house-door, and when the breeze parted the ears of corn so that she could see the blue sky through them, she thought how bright and beautiful it must be outside, and longed to see her dear swallow again.

She told him how unwilling she was to marry the ugly mole, as then she had to live underground where the sun never shone, and she could not help bursting into tears.

when the cattle began to grow so restless that it was impossible to keep
them in order. A number of different maidens tried to manage them, but
without avail; until one came who was betrothed, and whose betrothal had
but recently been celebrated. Then the cattle suddenly quieted down, and
were easy to handle. So the maiden remained alone in the hills with no
other company than a dog. And one afternoon as she sat in the hut, it
seemed to her that her sweetheart came, sat down beside her, and began
to talk about their getting married at once. But she sat still and made
no reply, for she noticed a strangeness about him. By and by, more and
more people came in. They began to cover the table with silverware,
and bring on dishes. The bridesmaids brought the bridal crown, and
the ornaments, and a handsome bridal gown. They dressed her, and put

in the most lamentable manner, and gave the people no rest until they
followed him. The young fellow who was to marry the girl took his gun,
and climbed the hills. When he drew near, there stood a number of
horses around the hut, saddled and bridled. He crept up to the hut,
looked through a loop-hole in the wall, and saw a whole company sitting
together inside. It was quite evident that they were trolls, the people
from underground, and therefore he discharged his gun over the roof. At
that moment the doors flew open, and a number of balls of gray yarn, one

not like most of the herdsmen's huts; but was well and solidly built,
and even had a chimney, a roof and a window. And there they spent the
summer. But when they came back home in the fall, the wood-cutters and

burned in the herdsman's hut that it lit up every road, and then he knew
that the mountain folk were inside. So he tied his horse to a pine-tree,
took a pistol from its holster, crept up to the hut, and peeped through
the window. And there sat an old man and a woman who were quite crooked and shriveled up with age, and so unspeakably ugly that he had never seen anything like it in his life; but with them was a maiden, and she was so surpassingly beautiful that he fell in love with her at once, and felt that he could not live without her.

""Now you may take her, for now she belongs to you!"" said the old man.
But the dragoon stood as though rooted to the spot; stood where he
stood, and could not take a single step, either forward or backward.
Then the old man began to wash the girl; and she looked a little better.

bride begged one of the bridesmaids to stand close behind her, so that
no one could see her tail fall off when the priest joined their hands.

So the wedding was celebrated, and when the dishes made the round, the
bridegroom went out into the room where the table had been set for the
old folk from the mountain. And at that time there was nothing to be

heartily weary of her. So it was bound to happen that he sometimes flew

go to town, and since it was fall, and the ground already frozen, the
horse had first to be shod. So he went into the smithy--for he himself
was a notable farrier--but, no matter what lie did, the horse-shoe was
either too large or too small, and would not fit at all. He had no other
horse at home, and he toiled away until noon and on into the afternoon.

not a very good husband; but you are a far worse farrier. I see there is

Then he ordered twelve coffins to be made, and filled them with shavings, and placed a little pillow in each. These he put away in an empty room, and, giving the key to his wife, he bade her tell no one of it.

The Queen grieved over the sad fate of her sons and refused to be comforted, so much so that the youngest boy, who was always with her, and whom she had christened Benjamin, said to her one day:

'Yes,' replied his mother, 'that is what you must do-go with your eleven brothers out into the wood, and let one of you always sit on the highest tree you can find, keeping watch on the tower of the castle.

So they went forth into the wood, and shot hares and roe-deer, birds and wood-pigeons, and any other game they came across.

'Who in the world do these shirts belong to? Surely they are far too small for my father?'

And the Queen answered sadly: 'Dear child, they belong to your twelve brothers.'

'But where are my twelve brothers?' said the girl. 'I have never even heard of them.'

So she took the twelve shirts and went on straight into the middle of the big wood. She walked all day long, and came in the evening to the little enchanted house. She stepped in and found a youth who, marvelling at her beauty, at the royal robes she wore, and at the golden star on her forehead, asked her where she came from and whither she was going.

'But,' she replied, 'I will gladly die if by that means I can restore my twelve brothers to their own.'

'Then tell us,' they cried.

But he answered: 'Only on condition that you promise faithfully that the first girl we meet shall not be killed.'

'She shall be spared,' they promised, 'only tell us the news.'

The girl, wishing to please her brothers, plucked the twelve flowers, meaning to present one to each of them as they sat at supper. But hardly had she plucked the flowers when her brothers were turned into twelve ravens, who flew croaking over the wood, and the house and garden vanished also.

If she is deaf and can't speak, she might at least laugh; depend upon it, those who don't laugh have a bad conscience.'

The old woman kept the girls hard at work, from morning till night, spinning gold flax into yarn, and when one distaff was empty another was given them, so they had no rest. The thread had to be fine and even, and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman, who twice or thrice every summer went a journey.

""How can I help you?"" asked the raven. She answered: ""Fly away, until you come to a splendid town, where stands a king's palace; seek out the king's son and tell him that a great misfortune has befallen me."" Then she told the raven how her thread had lost its brightness, how terribly angry the old woman was, and how she feared some great disaster.

At last he became so ill his life was despaired of, and in great alarm the King caused all the wizards of his country to be summoned. But none could cure him.

He told them what had befallen their sister the year before, and how he had twice heard a strange song, but yet could see no singer. They said that the yellow water-lily could be none other than their sister, who was not dead, but transformed by the magic ball. Before he went to bed, the eldest made a cake of magic herbs, which she gave him to eat. In the night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand all that the birds said to each other.

""And he is to blame for all her misfortunes,"" added the magpie. ""If he heeds only the words of men she will remain a flower for ever. She were soon delivered were the matter only laid before the old wizard of Finland.""

After hearing this, the Prince wondered how he could get a message conveyed to Finland. He heard one swallow say to another: ""Come, let us fly to Finland; we can build better nests there.""

""Stop, kind friends!"" cried the Prince. ""Will you do something for me?"" The birds consented, and he said: ""Take a thousand greetings from me to the wizard of Finland, and ask him how I may restore a maiden transformed into a flower to her own form.""",24,bird,is capable of,build_nest,What can birds do?,They can build nest.

Shortly after, he was sitting in the garden, thinking that the swallows must have forgotten his message, when he saw an eagle flying above him. The bird gradually descended until it perched on a tree close to the Prince and said: ""The wizard of Finland greets you and bids me say that you may free the maiden thus: Go to the river and smear yourself all over with mud; then say: 'From a man into a crab,' and you will become a crab. Plunge boldly into the water, swim as close as you can to the water-lily's roots, and loosen them from the mud and reeds. This done, fasten your claws into the roots and rise with them to the surface. Let the water flow all over the flower, and drift with the current until you come to a mountain ash tree on the left bank. There is near it a large stone.

The old wizard has not told you wrong, neither have the birds deceived you; hasten and dry the maiden's tears.""

""Nothing worse than death can befall me,"" thought the Prince, ""and death is better than endless sorrow."" So he mounted his horse and went to the bridge. Again he heard the water-lily's lament, and, hesitating no longer, smeared himself all over with mud, and, saying: ""From a man into a crab,"" plunged into the river. For one moment the water hissed in his ears, and then all was silent. He swam up to the plant and began to loosen its roots, but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds that this took him a long time. He then grasped them and rose to the surface, letting the water flow over the flower. The current carried them down the stream, but nowhere could he see the mountain ash. At last he saw it, and close by the large stone. Here he stopped and said: ""From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden,"" and to his delight found himself once more a prince, and the maiden was by his side.

While they were wondering how they should reach his father's court, they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses coming along the bank. In this they drove to the palace. The King and Queen were at church, weeping for their son, whom they had long mourned for dead. Great was their delight and astonishment when the Prince entered, leading the beautiful maiden by the hand. The wedding was at once celebrated and there was feasting and merry-making throughout the kingdom for six weeks.

Some time afterward the Prince and his bride were sitting in the garden, when a crow said to them: ""Ungrateful creatures! Have you forgotten the two poor maidens who helped you in your distress? Must they spin gold flax for ever? Have no pity on the old witch.

She did see it, and thought it looked so tempting that she greedily ate it up and at once died.

boy of three or four years old, she led him out. Speaking very loud,
""See, my son,"" she said, ""your grandfather;"" and then added, in a tone
of appeal and supplication, ""he will have pity on us.""

The giant approached and said, with a loud ha! ha! ""Yes, my son;"" and
added, addressing the woman, ""Have you any thing to eat?""",29,custom,is a,practice,What is custom?,Habitual practice.
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,2,"By good luck the lodge was well supplied with meats of various kinds;
the woman thought to please him by handing him these, which were savory
and carefully prepared. But he pushed them away in disgust, saying, ""I
smell fire;"" and, not waiting to be invited, he seized upon the carcass
of a deer which lay by the door, and dispatched it almost without
stopping to take breath.

When the hunter came home he was surprised to see the monster, he was so
very frightful. He had again brought a deer, which he had no sooner put
down than the cannibal seized it, tore it in pieces, and devoured it as
though he had been fasting for a week. The hunter looked on in fear and
astonishment, and in a whisper he told his wife that he was afraid for
their lives, as this monster was one whom Indians call Weendigoes. He
did not even dare to speak to him, nor did the cannibal say a word, but
as soon as he had finished his meal, he stretched himself down and fell
asleep.

In the evening the Weendigo told the people that he should go out a
hunting; and he strided away toward the North. Toward morning he
returned, all besmeared with blood, but he did not make known where he
had been nor of what kind of game he had been in quest; although the
hunter and his wife had dreadful suspicions of the sport in which he had
been engaged. Withal his hunger did not seem to be staid, for he took
up the deer which the hunter had brought in, and devoured it eagerly,
leaving the family to make their meal of the dried meats which had been
reserved in the lodge.",149,whisper,is a,speaking,What is whisper?,The act of speaking in a quiet voice.
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,3,"In this manner the Weendigo and the hunter's family lived for some time,
and it surprised them that the monster never attempted their lives;
although he never slept at night, but always went out and returned, by
the break of day, stained with blood, and looking very wild and
famished. When there was no deer to be had wherewith to finish his
repast, he said nothing. In truth he was always still and gloomy, and he
seldom spoke to any of them; when he did, his discourse was chiefly
addressed to the boy.

One evening, after he had thus sojourned with them for many weeks, he
informed the hunter that the time had now arrived for him to take his
leave, but that before doing so, he would give him a charm that would
bring good luck to his lodge. He presented to him two arrows, and
thanking the hunter and his wife for their kindness, the Weendigo
departed, saying, as he left them, that he had all the world to travel
over.

The hunter and his wife were happy when he was gone, for they had looked
every moment to have been devoured by him. He tried the arrows, and they
never failed to bring down whatever they were aimed at.

They had lived on, prosperous and contented, for a year, when, one day,
the hunter being absent, his wife on going out of the lodge, saw
something like a black cloud approaching.",279,approach,has subevent,come,What is approach?,To come near.
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,4,"She looked until it came near, when she perceived that it was another
Weendigo or Giant Cannibal. Remembering the good conduct of the other,
she had no fear of this one, and asked him to look into the lodge.

He did so; and finding after he had glared around, that there was no
food at hand, he grew very wroth, and, being sorely disappointed, he
took the lodge and threw it to the winds. He seemed hardly at first to
notice the woman in his anger; but presently he cast a fierce glance
upon her, and seizing her by the waist, in spite of her cries and
entreaties, he bore her off. To the little son, who ran to and fro
lamenting, he paid no heed.

At night-fall, when the hunter returned from the forest, he was amazed.
His lodge was gone, and he saw his son sitting near the spot where it
had stood, shedding tears. The son pointed in the direction the Weendigo
had taken, and as the father hurried along he found the remains of his
wife strewn upon the ground.

The hunter blackened his face, and vowed in his heart that he would have
revenge. He built another lodge, and gathering together the bones of
his wife, he placed them in the hollow part of a dry tree.",248,hollow,is a,valley,What is a hollow?,A small valley between mountains.

and roaming about from place to place, striving to forget his
misfortune, and searching for the wicked Weendigo.

He had been gone but a little while one morning, when his son shot his
arrows out through the top of the lodge, and running out to look for
them, he could find them nowhere. The boy had been trying his luck, and
he was puzzled that he had shot his shafts entirely out of sight.

His father made him more arrows, and when he was again left alone, he
shot one of them out; but although he looked as sharply as he could
toward the spot where it fell, and ran thither at once, he could not
find it.

He shot another, which was lost in the same way; and returning to the
lodge to replenish his quiver, he happened to espy one of the lucky
arrows, which the first Weendigo had given to his father, hanging upon
the side of the lodge. He reached up, and having secured it, he shot it
out at the opening, and immediately running out to find where it fell,
he was surprised to see a beautiful boy just in the act of taking it up,
and hurrying away with it to a large tree, where he disappeared.",167,replenish,has subevent,fill,What is replenish?,To fill something again.

face of the boy looking out through an opening in the hollow part.

""Ha! ha!"" he said, ""my friend, come out and play with me;"" and he urged
the boy till he consented. They played and shot their arrows by turns.

Suddenly the young boy said, ""Your father is coming. We must stop.
Promise me that you will not tell him.""

The hunter's son promised, and the other disappeared in the tree.

When the hunter returned from the chase, his son sat demurely by the
fire. In the course of the evening he asked his father to make him a new
bow; and when he was questioned as to the use he could find for two
bows, he answered that one might break or get lost.

The father pleased at his son's diligence in the practice of the bow,
made him the two weapons; and the next day, as soon as his father had
gone away, the boy ran to the hollow tree, and invited his little friend
to come out and play; at the same time presenting to him the new bow.
They went and played in the lodge together, and in their sport they
raised the ashes all over it.

Suddenly again the youngest said, ""Your father is coming, I must leave.""",178,practice,causes,understand_better,How to understand something better?,With practice.
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,7,"He again exacted a promise of secresy, and went back to his tree. The
eldest took his seat near the fire.

When the hunter came in he was surprised to see the ashes scattered
about. ""Why, my son,"" he said, ""you must have played very hard to day to
raise such a dust all alone.""

""Yes,"" the boy answered, ""I was very lonesome, and I ran round and
round--that is the cause of it.""

The next day the hunter made ready for the chase as usual. The boy said,
""Father, try and hunt all day, and see what you can kill.""

He had no sooner set out than the boy called his friend, and they played
and chased each other round the lodge. They had great delight in each
other's company, and made merry by the hour. The hunter was again
returning, and came to a rising ground, which caught the winds as they
passed, and he heard his son laughing and making a noise, but the sounds
as they reached him on the hill-top, seemed as if they arose from two
persons playing.

At the same time the younger boy stopped, and after saying ""Your father
is coming,"" he stole away, under cover of the high grass, to his hollow
tree, which was not far off.",35,ash,is a,wood,What remains after the wood is burnt out?,Ashes.
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,8,"The hunter, on entering, found his son sitting by the fire, very quiet
and unconcerned, although he saw that all the articles of the lodge were
lying thrown about in all directions.

""Why, my son,"" he said ""you must play very hard every day; and what is
it that you do, all alone, to throw the lodge in such confusion?""

The boy again had his excuse. ""Father,"" he answered, ""I play in this
manner: I chase and drag my blanket around the lodge, and that is the
reason you see the ashes spread about.""

The hunter was not satisfied until his son had shown him how he played
with the blanket, which he did so adroitly as to set his father
laughing, and at last drive him out of the lodge with the great clouds
of ashes that he raised.

The next morning the boy renewed his request that his father should be
absent all day, and see if he could not kill two deer. The hunter
thought this a strange desire on the part of his son, but as he had
always humored the boy, he went into the forest as usual, bent on
accomplishing his wish, if he could.

As soon as he was out of sight, his son hastened to his young companion
at the tree, and they continued their sports.

The father on nearing his home in the evening, as he reached the rising
ground, again heard the sounds of play and laughter; and as the wind
brought them straight to his ear, he was now certain that there were two
voices.",72,confusion,is the antonym of,clarity,What is confusion?,A lack of clarity or order.
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,9,"The boy from the tree had no more than time to escape, when the hunter
entered, and found his son, sitting as usual, near the fire. When he
cast his eyes around, he saw that the lodge was in greater confusion
than before. ""My son,"" he said, ""you must be very foolish when alone to
play so. But, tell me, my son; I heard two voices, I am sure;"" and he
looked closely on the prints of the footsteps in the ashes. ""True,"" he
continued, ""here is the print of a foot which is smaller than my son's;""
and he was now satisfied that his suspicions were well founded, and that
some very young person had been the companion of his son.

The boy could not now refuse to tell his father what had happened.

""Father,"" he said, ""I found a boy in the hollow of that tree, near the
lodge, where you placed my mother's bones.""

Strange thoughts came over the mind of the hunter; did his wife live
again in this beautiful child?

Fearful of disturbing the dead, he did not dare to visit the place where
he had deposited her remains.

He, however, engaged his son to entice the boy to a dead tree, by the
edge of a wood, where they could kill many flying-squirrels by setting
it on fire. He said that he would conceal himself near by, and take the
boy.",147,companion,is a,friend,Who is the companion?,A friend with whom one spends time.

calling the boy from the tree, urged him to go with him to kill the
squirrels. The boy objected that his father was near, but he was at
length prevailed on to go, and after they had fired the tree, and while
they were busy killing or taking the squirrels, the hunter suddenly made
his appearance, and clasped the strange boy in his arms. He cried out,
""Kago, kago, don't, don't. You will tear my clothes!"" for he was clad in
a fine apparel, which shone as if it had been made of a beautiful
transparent skin. The father reassured him by every means in his power.

By constant kindness and gentle words the boy was reconciled to remain
with them; but chiefly by the presence of his young friend, the hunter's
son, to whom he was fondly attached. The children were never parted from
each other; and when the hunter looked upon the strange boy, he seemed
to see living in him the better spirit of his lost wife.",134,reassure,has subevent,assure,What is reassure?,To assure again.

lodge.

The hunter grew at ease in his spirit, and gave all of the time he could
spare from the chase to the society of the two children; but, what
affected him the most, both of his sons, although they were well-formed

by his lodge-door, the black giant who had slain his wife. He had been
stricken down by the magic shaft in the hands of the little stranger

Before the king's daughter began to grow up, the queen her mother fell ill and died.

She had an engaging appearance, a smooth tongue and a winning way of talking, and she was as soft and pliable as silk; but at heart she was full of machinations and falseness. Now when the queen died, she at once began to plan how she might marry the king, so that her daughters might be kept like royal princesses. With this end in view, she drew the young princess to her.

This made the step-mother very angry;. She concealed her rage, and was as sweet and friendly as ever. Among the wooers was a king's son from another country.

Not a day went by without her scolding and threatening the princess and the queen's daughters were every bit as malicious as their mother. But the king's son, the lover of the princess, found himself in even worse position. He had gone hunting one day, had lost his way, and could not find his people. Then the queen used her black arts and turned him into a werewolf, to wander through the forest for the remainder of his life in that shape. When evening came and there was no sign of the prince, his people returned home, and one can imagine what sorrow they caused when the princess learned how the hunt had ended.

But the queen had the last word in the end, and ordered that one of her daughters must accompany the princess, even though it be against her will. So the girls wandered out of the castle into the forest. The king's daughter walked among the trees, and listened to the song of the birds, and thought of her lover, for whom she longed, and who was now no longer there.

She seated herself on the rock, put her hand to her cheek, cried, and thought of her unkind step-mother and step-sisters, and of all the harsh words she would have to endure when she returned. And she thought of her father, the king, who was away at war, and of the love of her heart, whom she would never see again. She grieved so bitterly that she did not even know she wept. Night came and darkness, and the stars rose, and still the princess sat in the same spot and wept. And while she sat there, lost in her thoughts, she heard a voice say: ""Good evening, lovely maiden!

She did as he told her, gathered moss, brush and dry sticks, struck sparks and lit such a fire on the hill-top that the flame blazed up to the skies. That done the old man said: ""Go on a bit and you will find a kettle of tar, and bring the kettle to me."" This the king's daughter did. The old man continued: ""Now put the kettle on the fire.""

went over to the schoolmaster's. I knew they had plenty of herbs, but
the schoolmistress is very mean, although she can smile so sweetly. I
begged her to lend me a handful of herbs. 'Lend!' she exclaimed, 'I have

giants, and he had been informed that he had no other relative living
beside his grandfather. The band to whom he had belonged had put up
their children on a wager in a race against those of the giants, and had
thus lost them. There was an old tradition in the tribe, that, one day,
it would produce a great man, who would wear a white feather, and who
would astonish every one by his feats of skill and bravery.

The grandfather, as soon as the child could play about, gave him a bow
and arrows to amuse himself with. He went into the edge of the woods one
day, and saw a rabbit; but not knowing what it was, he ran home and
described it to his grandfather. He told him what it was, that its flesh
was good to eat, and that if he would shoot one of his arrows into its

in acquiring the knowledge of hunting, until he could kill deer and the
larger kinds of game; and he became, as he grew up, an expert hunter.

As they lived alone, and away from other Indians, the curiosity of the
stripling was excited to know what was passing in the world. One day he
came to the edge of a prairie, where he saw ashes like those at his
grandfather's lodge, and lodge-poles left standing.",70,expert,is capable of,answer_question,Who can answer difficult questions in a certain field?,Experts in the field.

seen any thing of the kind. He must have lost his senses to be talking
of such things.

Another day the young man went out to see what there was, within a day's
hunt, that was curious; and on entering the woods he heard a voice
calling out to him, ""Come here, you destined wearer of the White
Feather. You do not wear it, yet, but you are worthy of it. Return home
and take a short nap. You will dream of hearing a voice, which will tell
you to rise and smoke. You will see in your dream a pipe, a
smoking-sack, and a large white feather. When you awake you will find
these articles. Put the feather on your head, and you will become a
great hunter, a great warrior, and a great man, able to do any thing. As
a proof that these things shall come to pass, when you smoke, the smoke
will turn into pigeons.""

The voice then informed the young man who he was, and made known the
character of his grandfather, who was imposing upon him to serve his own
ends.

The voice-spirit then caused a vine to be laid at his side, and told him
that he was now of an age to avenge the wrongs of his kindred. ""When you
meet your enemy,"" the spirit added, ""you will run a race with him. He
will not see the vine, because it is enchanted. While you are running,

the race.""",71,curious,causes,learn_about_world,What is the driving force of learning about the world?,Being curious.

great age, was wood from the breast downward, and that he appeared to be
fixed in the earth. As his eye dwelt upon this strange being, the
countenance by degrees faded away, and when he advanced to the spot
whence it had addressed him, it was gone.

He returned home; slept; in the midst of his slumbers, as from the
hollow of the air, heard the voice; wakened and found the promised
gifts. His grandfather, when his attention was called to his awakening,
was greatly surprised to find the youth with a white feather on his
forehead, and to see flocks of pigeons flying out of his lodge. He then
remembered the old tradition, and knowing that now the day when he
should lose control of his charge had begun, he bitterly bewailed the
hour.

white-feather-and-the-six-giants,5,"The six giants lived in a very high lodge in the middle of a wood. He
traveled on, in good heart, till he reached this lodge, where he found
that his coming had been made known by the little spirits who carry the
news. The giants hastened out, and gave a cry of joy as they saw him
drawing near. When he approached within hail, they began to make sport
of him, saying, ""Here comes the little man with the white feather, who
is to achieve such wonderful wonders.""

When, however, he had arrived among them, they spoke him fair, saying he
was a brave man and would do brave things. Their object was to encourage
him, so that he would be bold to engage in some fool-hardy trial of
strength.

Without paying much heed to their fine speeches, White Feather went
fearlessly into their lodge; and without waiting for invitation, he
challenged them to a foot-match. They agreed; and, as they said, by way
of being easy with him, they told him to begin the race with the
smallest of their number.

The point to which they were to run was a peeled tree toward the rising
sun, and then back to the starting-place, which was a war-club of iron.
Whoever won this stake, was empowered to use it in dispatching the
defeated champion. If White Feather should overcome the first giant, he
was to try the second, and so on, until they had all measured speed with
him. By a dexterous use of the vine, he gained the first race, struck
down his competitor, and cut off his head.",173,invitation,causes,go_to_party,What should you get before going to a party?,The invitation.

He went on in this way for the five mornings, always conquering by the
aid of his vine, and lopping off the heads of the vanquished giants.

The last of the giants who was yet to run with him acknowledged his
power, but prepared secretly to deceive him. By way of parley, he
proposed that White Feather should leave the heads with him, and that he
would give him a handsome start for odds. This White Feather declined,
as he preferred to keep the heads as trophies of his victory.

Before going to the giant's lodge, on the sixth morning, he met his old
counselor in the woods, standing rooted in the earth, as before. He told
White Feather that he was about to be deceived; that he had never known
any other sex but his own, but that as he went on his way to the lodge
he would meet the most beautiful woman in the world. He must pay no
attention to her, but as soon as he caught her eye he must wish himself
changed into an elk. The change would take place immediately, and he
must go to feeding and not look at her again.

White Feather thanked his kind adviser, and when he turned to take his
leave he was gone as before.",37,vine,is a,plant,What is the vine?,The climbing plant that produces grapes.

form of a man that he might avoid her.

""I have traveled a great distance,"" she added, ""to see you and to become
your wife; for I have heard of your great achievements, and admire you
very much.""

Now this woman was the sixth giant, who had assumed this disguise to
entrap White Feather.

Without a suspicion of her real character, her reproaches and her beauty
affected him so deeply that he wished himself a man again, and he at
once resumed his natural shape. They sat down together, and he began to
caress and to make love to her.

Soothed by her smiles and her gracious manners, he ventured to lay his
head on her lap, and in a little while he fell into a deep slumber.

Even then, such was her fear of White Feather, she doubted whether his
sleep might not be feigned. To assure herself she pushed his head aside,
and seeing that he remained unconscious, she quickly assumed her own
form as the sixth giant, took the plume from the brow of White Feather
and placed it upon his own head, and with a sudden blow of his war-club
changed him into a dog, in which degraded form he followed his enemy to
the lodge.",105,reproach,is a,dissatisfaction,How to show dissatisfaction?,With reproaches.
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,8,"While these things were passing, there were living in an Indian village
at some distance, two sisters, the daughters of a chief, who were
rivals, and they were at that very time fasting to acquire power, for
the purpose of enticing the wearer of the white feather to visit their
lodge. They each secretly hoped to engage his affections, and each had
built a lodge in the border of the village encampment.

The giant knowing this, and having become possessed of the magic plume,
went immediately to visit them. As he approached, the sisters, who were
on the look-out at their lodge-doors, espied and recognized the feather.

The eldest sister had prepared her lodge with great show, and all the
finery she could command, so as to attract the eye. The youngest
touched nothing in her lodge, but left it in its ordinary state.

The eldest went out to meet the giant, and invited him in. He accepted
her invitation, and made her his wife. The youngest sister invited the
enchanted dog into her lodge, prepared him a good supper and a neat bed,
and treated him with much attention.

The giant, supposing that whoever possessed the white feather possessed
also all its virtues, went out upon the prairie to hunt, hallooing aloud
to the game to come and be killed; but the great hubbub he kept up
scared them away, and he returned at night with nothing but himself; for
he had shouted so lustily all day long that he had been even obliged to
leave the mighty halloo, with which he had set out, behind.",28,rival,has subevent,compete,Who will compete with you?,The rival.

stole quietly along to the spot, and stepping into the water he drew out
a stone, which instantly became a beaver.

The next day the giant followed the dog, and hiding behind a tree, he
watched the manner in which the dog hunted in the river when he drew out
a stone, which at once turned into a beaver.

""Ah, ha!"" said the giant to himself, ""I will catch some beaver for
myself.""

And as soon as the dog had left the place, the giant went to the river,
and, imitating the dog, he drew out a stone, and was delighted to see
it, as soon as it touched the land, change into a fine fat beaver.

Tying it to his belt he hastened home, shouting a good deal, and
brandishing the white feather about, as if he were prepared now to show
them what he could do when he once tried. When he reached home he threw
it down, as is the custom, at the door of the lodge before he entered.

After being seated a short time, he gave a dry cough, and bade his wife
bring in his hunting girdle. She made dispatch to obey him, and
presently returned with the girdle, with nothing tied to it but a stone.",246,obey,is the antonym of,defy,What is the antonym of defy?,Obey.

been discovered, went to a wood at some distance, and broke off a
charred limb from a burned tree, which instantly became a bear. The
giant, who appeared to have lost faith in his hulla-balooing, had again
watched him, did exactly as the dog had done, and carried a bear home;
but his wife, when she came to go out for it, found nothing but a black
stick tied to his belt.

And so it happened with every thing. Whatever the dog undertook,
prospered; whatever the giant attempted, failed. Every day the youngest
sister had reason to be more proud of the poor dog she had asked into
her lodge, and every day the eldest sister was made more aware, that
though she had married the white feather, the virtues of the magic
plume were not the personal property of the noisy giant.",172,property,is a,possession,What is property?,The possession owned by someone.

make known to him what a valuable husband she had, and how he furnished
her lodge with a great abundance of sticks and stones, which he would
pass upon her for bear and beaver. So, when her husband, whose brave
halloo had now died away to a feeble chirp, had started for the hunt,
she set out.

As soon as these two had gone away from the neighborhood, the dog made
signs to his mistress to sweat him after the manner of the Indians. He
had always been a good dog, and she was willing to oblige him. She
accordingly made a lodge just large enough for him to creep in. She then
put in heated stones, and poured water upon them, which raised a vapor
that filled the lodge and searched with its warmth to the very heart's
core of the enchanted dog.",164,warmth,causes,light_fire,What do you feel when you light a fire?,Warmth.
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,12,"When this had been kept up for the customary time, the enchanted dog was
completely sweated away, and in his stead, as might have been expected,
out came a very handsome young man, but, unhappily, without the power of
speech. In taking away the dog, it appears that the sweating-lodge had
also carried off the voice with it.

Meantime the elder sister had reached her father's, and, with much
circumstance and a very long face, had told him how that her sister was
supporting an idle dog, and entertaining him as her husband. In her
anxiety to make known her sister's affairs and the great scandal she was
bringing upon the family, the eldest forgot to say any thing of the
sticks and stones which her own husband brought home for bears and
beavers. The old man suspecting that there was magic about her house,
sent a deputation of young men and women to ask his youngest daughter to
come to him, and to bring her dog along with her. When the deputation
reached the lodge, they were surprised to find, in the place of the dog,
a fine young man; and on announcing their message, they all returned to
the old chief, who was no less surprised at the change.

He immediately assembled all the old and wise heads of the nation to
come and be witnesses to the exploits which it was reported that the
young man could perform. The sixth giant, although neither very old nor
very wise, thrust himself in among the relations of the old chief.",156,suspect,has subevent,think,What is suspect?,To think something is true without proof.
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,13,"When they were all assembled and seated in a circle, the old chief took
his pipe and filled it, and passed it to the Indians around, to see if
any thing would happen when they smoked. They passed it on until it came
around to the Dog, who made a sign that it should be handed first to the
giant, which was done. And the giant puffed with all his might, and
shook the white feather upon his head, and swelled his chest; but
nothing came of it, except a great deal of smoke. The Dog then took it
himself. He made a sign to them to put the white feather upon his head.
This was no sooner done, than he recovered his speech, and, beginning to
draw upon the pipe at the same moment, behold, immense flocks of white
and blue pigeons rushed from the smoke.

From that moment the sixth giant was looked upon as an impostor, and as
soon as White Feather had, at the request of the company, faithfully
recounted his history, the old chief, who was one of the best-hearted
magicians that ever lived, ordered that the giant should be transformed
into a dog, and turned into the middle of the village, where the boys
should pelt him to death with clubs; which being done, the whole six
giants were at an end, and never troubled that neighborhood again,
forever after.

The chief then gave out a command, at the request of White Feather, that
all the young men should employ themselves four days in making arrows.
White Feather also asked for a buffalo robe. This he cut into thin
shreds, and in the night, when no one knew of it, he went and sowed them
about the prairie in every direction.",91,chest,is a,box,What is a chest?,Usually a large strong box with a secure lid.

their arrows, and to accompany him to a buffalo hunt. When they got out
upon the prairie, they found it covered with a great herd of buffaloes.
Of these they killed as many as they pleased, and, afterward, they had a
grand festival in honor of White Feather's triumph over the giants.

All this being pleasantly over, White Feather got his wife to ask her
father's permission to go with him on a visit to his grandfather. The
old chief replied to this application, that a woman must follow her
husband into whatever quarter of the world he may choose to go.

Bidding farewell to all his friends, White Feather placed the plume in
his frontlet, and taking his war-club in his hand, he led the way into
the forest, followed by his faithful wife.",69,white,is a,opposite_of_black,What is the opposite of black?,White.
white-hare-and-crocodiles,1,"Long, long ago, when all the animals could talk, there lived in the province of Inaba in Japan, a little white hare. His home was on the island of Oki. Just across the sea was the mainland of Inaba.

Now the hare wanted very much to cross over to Inaba. Day after day he would go out and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of Inaba. Day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across.

One day as usual, the hare was standing on the beach, looking towards the mainland across the water, when he saw a great crocodile swimming near the island.

""This is very lucky!"" thought the hare. ""Now I shall be able to get my wish. I will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea!""",121,crocodile,is a,reptile,What is a crocodile?,"A crocodile is a large, ferocious meat-eating reptile."
white-hare-and-crocodiles,2,"But he was doubtful whether the crocodile would consent to do what wanted. So he thought instead of asking a favor he would try to get what he wanted by a trick.

So with a loud voice he called to the crocodile, and said:

""Oh, Mr. Crocodile, isn't it a lovely day?""

The crocodile, who had come out all by itself that day to enjoy the bright sunshine, was just beginning to feel a bit lonely when the hare's cheerful greeting broke the silence. The crocodile swam nearer the shore, very pleased to hear some one speak.",8,consent,is a,permission,What does it mean to consent?,To consent means to give permission.

The crocodile came out of the sea and sat on the shore, and the two played together for some time. Then the hare said:

""Mr. Crocodile, you live in the sea and I live on this island. We do not often meet, so I know very little about you. Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?""

""Of course, there are more crocodiles than hares,"" answered the crocodile. ""Can you not see that for yourself? You live on this small island, while I live in the sea, which spreads through all parts of the world. If I call together all the crocodiles who dwell in the sea you hares will be as nothing compared to us!"" The crocodile was very conceited.",118,island,is a,small_body_of_land,What is an island?,An island is a small body of land totally surrounded by water.
white-hare-and-crocodiles,4,"The hare, who meant to play a trick on the crocodile, said:

""Do you think it possible for you to call up enough crocodiles to form a line from this island across the sea to Inaba?""

The crocodile thought for a moment and then answered:

""Of course, it is possible.""

""Then do try,"" said the crafty hare, ""and I will count the number from here!""",76,count,has subevent,recite,What does it mean to count?,To count means to recite numbers in sequence.
white-hare-and-crocodiles,5,"The crocodile, who was very simple-minded, and who hadn't the least idea that the hare intended to play a trick on him, agreed to do what the hare asked. He said:

""Wait a little while I go back into the sea and call my company together!""

The crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time. The hare, meanwhile, waited patiently on the shore. At last the crocodile appeared, bringing with him a large number of other crocodiles.

""Look, Mr. Hare!"" said the crocodile, ""it is nothing for my friends to form a line between here and Inaba. There are enough crocodiles to stretch from here even as far as China or India. Did you ever see so many crocodiles?""",57,plunge,has subevent,dart,What does it mean to plunge?,To plunge means to dart into water.
white-hare-and-crocodiles,6,"Then the whole company of crocodiles arranged themselves in the water so as to form a bridge between the Island of Oki and the mainland of Inaba. When the hare saw the bridge of crocodiles, he said:

""How splendid! I did not believe this was possible. Now let me count you all! To do this, however, with your permission, I must walk over on your backs to the other side. Please be so good as not to move, or else I shall fall into the sea and be drowned!""

So the hare hopped off the island on to the strange bridge of crocodiles, counting as he jumped from one crocodile's back to the other:

""Please keep quite still, or I shall not be able to count. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine-""

Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of Inaba. Not content with getting his wish, he began to jeer at the crocodiles instead of thanking them. He said, as he leapt off the last one's back:

""Oh! you stupid crocodiles, now I have done with you!""",187,jeer,has subevent,tease,What does ot mean to jeer at someone?,It means to tease someone.

So soon as the crocodiles understood that this was a trick played upon them by the hare so as to enable him to cross the sea, and that the hare was now laughing at them for their stupidity, they became furiously angry and made up their minds to take revenge. So some of them ran after the hare and caught him. Then they all surrounded the poor little animal and pulled out all his fur. He cried out loudly and entreated them to spare him, but with each tuft of fur they pulled out they said:

""Serve you right!""

When the crocodiles had pulled out the last bit of fur, they threw the poor hare on the beach, and all swam away laughing at what they had done.",100,fur,is a,coat,What is fur?,Fur refers to the hairy coat of various mammal species.
white-hare-and-crocodiles,8,"The hare was now in a pitiful plight, all his beautiful white fur had been pulled out. His bare little body was quivering with pain and bleeding all over. He could hardly move. All he could do was to lie on the beach quite helpless and weep over the misfortune that had befallen him. Despite that it was his own fault that had brought all this misery and suffering upon the white hare of Inaba, any one seeing the poor little creature could not help feeling sorry for him in his sad condition. The crocodiles had been very cruel in their revenge.

Just at this time a number of men, who looked like King's sons, happened to pass by. Seeing the hare lying on the beach crying, they stopped and asked what was the matter.

The hare lifted up his head from between his paws, and answered them, saying:

""I had a fight with some crocodiles, but I was beaten. They pulled out all my fur and left me to suffer here-that is why I am crying.""",24,quiver,has subevent,tremble,What does it mean to quiver?,To quiver means to tremble.

Then all the young men passed on. The hare was very pleased, thinking that he had found a cure. He went and bathed in the sea and then came out and sat where the wind could blow upon him.

But as the wind blew and dried him, his skin became drawn and hardened, and the salt increased the pain so much that he rolled on the sand in his agony and cried aloud.",162,agony,is a,pain,What is agony?,Agony is extreme pain.
white-hare-and-crocodiles,10,"Just then another King's son passed by, carrying a great bag on his back. He saw the hare, and stopped and asked why he was crying so loudly.

But the poor hare, remembering that he had been deceived by one very like the man who now spoke to him, did not answer, but continued to cry.

But this man had a kind heart, and looked at the hare very pityingly, and said:

""You poor thing! I see that your fur is all pulled out and that your skin is quite bare. Who can have treated you so cruelly?""

When the hare heard these kind words he felt very grateful to the man. Encouraged by his gentle manner the hare told him all that had befallen him. The little animal hid nothing from his friend, but told him frankly how he had played a trick on the crocodiles and how he had come across the bridge they had made, thinking that he wished to count their number. He told him how he had jeered at them for their stupidity, and then how the crocodiles had revenged themselves on him. Then he went on to say how he had been deceived by a party of men who looked very like his kind friend. The hare ended his long tale of woe by begging the man to give him some medicine that would cure him and make his fur grow again.",252,medicine,is a,drug,What is medicine?,Medicine refers to pharmaceutical drugs.
white-hare-and-crocodiles,11,"When the hare had finished his story, the man was full of pity towards him, and said:

""I am very sorry for all you have suffered, but remember, it was only the consequence of the deceit you practiced on the crocodiles.""

""I know,"" answered the sorrowful hare, ""but I have repented and made up my mind never to use deceit again. I beg you to show me how I may cure my sore body and make the fur grow again.""

""Then I will tell you of a good remedy,"" said the man. ""First go and bathe well in that pond over there and try to wash all the salt from your body. Then pick some of those kaba flowers that are growing near the edge of the water. Spread them on the ground and roll yourself on them. If you do this the pollen will cause your fur to grow again, and you will be quite well in a little while.""",167,pollen,is part of,flowers,What is pollen?,"Pollen is a fine, granular substance produced from flowers."
white-hare-and-crocodiles,12,"The hare was very glad to be told what to do, so kindly. He crawled to the pond pointed out to him, bathed well in it. He then picked the kaba flowers growing near the water, and rolled himself on them.

To his amazement, even while he was doing this, he saw his nice white fur growing again. The pain ceased, and he felt just as he had done before all his misfortunes.

The hare was overjoyed at his quick recovery. He went hopping joyfully towards the young man who had so helped him, and kneeling down at his feet, said:

""I cannot express my thanks for all you have done for me! It is my earnest wish to do something for you in return. Please tell me who you are?""

""I am no King's son as you think me. I am a fairy, and my name is Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto,"" answered the man. ""Those beings who passed here before me are my brothers. They have heard of a beautiful Princess called Yakami who lives in this province of Inaba, and they are on their way to find her and to ask her to marry one of them.

I am quite sure that the Princess, whom your brothers have gone to seek, will refuse to be the bride of any of them. She will prefer you for your goodness of heart.

""To you I give myself,"" and so they were married.

wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,1,"In time past--we can not tell exactly how many, many years ago--a poor
Indian was living, with his wife and children, in a beautiful part of
the country. He was not only poor, but he had the misfortune to be
inexpert in procuring food for his family. His children were all too
young to give him assistance.

Although of a lowly condition and straitened in his circumstances, he
was a man of kind and contented disposition. He was always thankful to
the Great Spirit for every thing he received. He even stood in the door
of his lodge to bless the birds that flew past in the summer evenings.
Although, if he had been of a complaining temper, he might have repined
that they were not rather spread upon the table for his evening meal.

The same gracious and sweet disposition was inherited by his eldest son,
who had now arrived at the proper age to undertake the ceremony of the
fast. This was to learn what kind of a spirit would be his guide and guardian
through life.

Wunzh, for this was his name, had been an obedient boy from his

whole family.",7,tell,is the antonym of,ask,What is opposite to telling?,Asking.
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,2,"As soon as the first buds of spring appeared, and the delicious
fragrance of the young year began to sweeten the air, his father, with
the help of his younger brothers, built for Wunzh the customary little
lodge. It was at a retired spot at some distance from their own, where he would
not be disturbed during the solemn rite.

To prepare himself, Wunzh sought to clear his heart of every evil
thought, and to think of nothing that was not good, and beautiful, and
kindly.

That he might store his mind with pleasant ideas for his dreams, for the
first few days he amused himself by walking in the woods and over the
mountains, examining the early plants and flowers.

As he rambled far and wide, through the wild country, he felt a strong
desire to know how the plants and herbs and berries grew, without any
aid from man. He wondered why it was that some kinds were good to eat, and that
others were possessed of medicinal or poisonous power.

After he had become too weak to walk about, and confined himself
strictly to the lodge, he recalled these thoughts, and turning them in
his mind, he wished he could dream of something that would prove a
benefit to his father and family, and to all others of his
fellow-creatures.",162,grow,is the antonym of,shrink,What is opposite to growing?,Shrinking.

food, than by hunting animals and taking fish? I must try to find this
out in my visions.""

On the third day Wunzh became weak and faint, and kept his bed. Suddenly
he fancied, as he lay thus, that a bright light came in at the lodge
door. Before he was aware, he saw a handsome young man, with a
complexion of the softest and purest white, coming down from the sky,
and advancing toward him.

The beautiful stranger was richly and gayly dressed, having on a great
many garments of green and yellow colors, but differing in their deeper
or lighter shades. He had a plume of waving feathers on his head, and
all his motions were graceful. He reminded Wunzh of the deep green of
the summer grass, and the clear amber of the summer sky, and the gentle
blowing of the summer wind. Beautiful as the stranger was, he paused on
a little mound of earth, just before the door of the lodge.

""I am sent to you, my friend,"" said this celestial visitor, in a voice
most soft and musical to listen to. ""I am sent to you by that Great
Spirit who made all things in the sky, and on the earth. He has seen and
knows your motives in fasting. He sees that it is from a kind and
benevolent wish to do good to your people, and to procure a benefit for
them. He sees that you do not seek for strength in war, or the praise of the men
of the bloody hand. I am sent to instruct you and to show you how you
can do your kindred good.""",335,hand,is the antonym of,foot,What is opposite to hands?,Feet.

It was only by this means that he could hope to succeed in his
wishes.

Wunzh knew how weak he was from fasting, but the voice of the stranger
was cheery, and put such a courage in his heart, that he promptly sprang
up, determined to die rather than fail. Brave Wunzh! if you ever
accomplish any thing, it will be through the power of the resolve that
spoke within you at that moment.

He began the trial, and after a long-sustained struggle he was almost
overpowered, when the beautiful stranger said:

""My friend, it is enough for once, I will come again to try you;"" and
smiling on him, he returned through the air in the same direction in
which he had come.

The next day, although he saw how sweetly the wild-flowers bloomed upon
the slopes, and the birds warbled from the woodland, he longed to see
the celestial visitor, and to hear his voice.

To his great joy he reappeared at the same hour, toward the going down
of the sun, and re-challenged Wunzh to a trial of strength.",118,stranger,is the antonym of,compatriot,What is opposite to a stranger?,Compatriot.

spoke to him in the words he used before, adding:

""To-morrow will be your last trial. Be strong, my friend, for this is
the only way in which you can overcome me and obtain the boon you seek.""

The light which shone after him as he left Wunzh was brighter than
before.

On the third day he came again and renewed the struggle. Very faint in
body was poor Wunzh, but he was stronger at heart than ever, and
determined to prevail now or perish. He put forth his utmost powers, and
after a contest more severe than either of the others, the stranger
ceased his efforts, and declared himself conquered.

For the first time he entered Wunzh's little fasting-lodge. Sitting
down beside the youth, he began to deliver his instructions to him and

victory.",210,advantage,is the antonym of,disadvantage,What is opposite to advantage?,Disadvantage.

tell you what you must do to benefit your family and your people.

my garments and throw me down, clean the earth of roots and weeds, make
it soft, and bury me in the spot. When you have done this, leave my body
in the earth, and do not disturb it. Come at times to visit the
place, to see whether I have come to life. Above all be careful to
never let the grass or weeds grow upon my grave. Once a month cover me
with fresh earth. If you follow these my instructions you will
accomplish your object of doing good to your fellow-creatures by

you must not sacrifice your life. The Master of Life does not require

particular reason for extending my fast to that hour.""

""Very well,"" said the old man, ""I shall wait till the hour arrives, and
you shall be inclined to eat.""

At his usual hour of appearing, the beautiful sky-visitor returned, and
the trial of strength was renewed. Although he had not availed himself
of his father's offer of food, Wunzh felt that new strength had been
given him. His heart was mighty within him to achieve some great
purpose. Courage was like the eagle that spreads his wings within the
tree-top for a great flight, within the bosom of the brave Wunzh.

He grasped his angel challenger with supernatural strength and threw him
down. Mindful of his own instructions, he tore from him his beautiful
garments and plume. Finding him dead, he immediately buried him on

As it had been appointed to him during the days of his fasting to
walk apart with Heaven, he was not permitted to see any human face save
that of his father, the representative to the little household upon
earth of the Good Father who is in Heaven.

Wunzh partook sparingly of the meal that had been prepared for him, and
once more mingled in the cares and sports of the family. But he never
for a moment forgot the grave of his friend. He carefully visited it
throughout the spring, and weeded out the grass, and kept the ground in
a soft and pliant state. Sometimes, when the brave Wunzh thought of
his friend that was gone from his sight, he dropped a tear upon the
earth where he lay.

Watching and tending, and moistening the earth with his tears, it was
not long before Wunzh saw the tops of green plumes coming through the
ground. The more faithful he was in obeying his instructions in
keeping the ground in order, and in cherishing the memory of his
departed friend, the faster they grew. He was, however, careful to
conceal the charge of the earth which he had from his father.

Days and weeks had passed in this way. The summer was drawing toward a
close, when one day, after a long absence in hunting, Wunzh invited his

blowing of the summer wind.

""It is my friend!"" shouted Wunzh, ""it is the friend of all mankind. It

the stranger. He told him that the broad husks must be torn away, as he
had pulled off the garments in his wrestling. Having done this, he
directed him how the ear must be held before the fire till the outer
skin became brown--as he complexion of his angel friend had been tinted
by the sun--while all the milk was retained in the grain.

The whole family, in high spirits, and deeply grateful to the Merciful

When the folk at the castle had gone to bed, the rat crept around, and
sniffed and spied out the room of the prince and princess; and at last
he found a little hole through which he crawled. Then he heard the
prince and princess talking to each other, and saw that the prince was
wearing the ring on his finger. Before she went, the princess said:
""Good night. And see that you take good care of the ring, my dearest!""

""Pooh! no one will come in through the walls for the sake of a ring,""

that the ring flew out and rolled along the ground. Swish!--the rat had
caught it, and crept out with it to the cat, who was waiting at the
rat-hole. But in the meantime the king had caught the youth, and had had
him put in a great tower and condemned to death, because he had made a
mock of his daughter--so the king said. And the youth was to sit in the
tower until he was beheaded. But the cat kept prowling around the tower
all the time, trying to sneak in with the ring. And then an eagle came
along, caught her up in his claws and flew across the sea with her. And
suddenly a hawk appeared, and flung himself on the eagle, and the eagle
let the cat fall into the sea. When she felt the water, she grew afraid,
let the ring fall, and swam to land. No sooner had she shaken the water
from her fur than she met the dog whom the youth's master had bought for
him.

""Well, what am I to do now?"" said the cat, and wept and lamented. ""The
ring is gone, and they want to murder the youth."" ""That I do not know,""
