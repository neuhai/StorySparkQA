assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,1,"In far bygone days, in the North, there lived a well-to-do farmer, who
had seven sons and one daughter. And the youngest of these seven sons
bore a very curious name; for men called him Assipattle, which means,
""He who grovels among the ashes.""

Perhaps Assipattle deserved his name, for he was rather a lazy boy, who
never did any work on the farm as his brothers did, but ran about the
doors with ragged clothes and unkempt hair, and whose mind was ever
filled with wondrous stories of Trolls and Giants, Elves and Goblins.

When the sun was hot in the long summer afternoons, when the bees droned
drowsily and even the tiny insects seemed almost asleep, the boy was
content to throw himself down on the ash-heap amongst the ashes, and lie
there, lazily letting them run through his fingers, as one might play
with sand on the sea-shore, basking in the sunshine and telling stories
to himself.",161,finger,is at location of,glove,What can you wear on your fingers to keep them warm?,A glove.

mocking fingers, and laugh, and say to each other how well the name
suited him, and of how little use he was in the world.

And when they came home from their work, they would push him about and
tease him, and even his mother would make him sweep the floor, and draw
water from the well, and fetch peats from the peat-stack, and do all the
little odd jobs that nobody else would do.

assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,3,"But one day a very sad thing happened--at least, it was a sad thing for
poor Assipattle.

For it chanced that the King of these parts had one only daughter, the
Princess Gemdelovely, whom he loved dearly, and to whom he denied
nothing. And Princess Gemdelovely was in want of a waiting-maid, and as
she had seen Assipattle's sister standing by the garden gate as she was
riding by one day, and had taken a fancy to her, she asked her father if
she might ask her to come and live at the Castle and serve her.

Her father agreed at once, as he always did agree to any of her wishes;
and sent a messenger in haste to the farmer's house to ask if his
daughter would come to the Castle to be the Princess's waiting-maid.

And, of course, the farmer was very pleased at the piece of good fortune
which had befallen the girl, and so was her mother, and so were her six
brothers, all except poor Assipattle, who looked with wistful eyes after
his sister as she rode away, proud of her new clothes and of the rivlins
which her father had made her out of cowhide, which she was to wear in

barefoot.",48,deny,is the antonym of,confirm,What is the opposite of deny?,Confirm.

assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,4,"Time passed, and one day a rider rode in hot haste through the country
bearing the most terrible tidings. For the evening before, some
fishermen, out in their boats, had caught sight of the Mester Stoorworm,
which, as everyone knows, was the largest, and the first, and the
greatest of all Sea-Serpents. It was that beast which, in the Good Book,
is called the Leviathan, and if it had been measured in our day, its
tail would have touched Iceland, while its snout rested on the North
Cape.

And the fishermen had noticed that this fearsome Monster had its head
turned towards the mainland, and that it opened its mouth and yawned
horribly, as if to show that it was hungry, and that, if it were not
fed, it would kill every living thing upon the land, both man and beast,
bird and creeping thing.

For it was well known that its breath was so poisonous that it consumed
as with a burning fire everything that it lighted on. So that, if it

In answer to her mother's questions, Minda revealed the truth, and made known her lover's request. The mother, considering the lonely and destitute condition of her little household, gave her consent.

The daughter, with light steps, hastened with the news to the wood. The bird lover of course heard it with delight, and fluttered through the air in happy circles, and poured forth a song of joy which thrilled Minda to the heart.

He said that he would come to the lodge at sunset, and immediately took wing, while Minda hung fondly upon his flight, till he was lost far away in the blue sky.

With the twilight the bird lover, whose name was Monedowa, appeared at the door of the lodge, as a hunter, with a red plume and a mantle of blue upon his shoulders.

He addressed the widow as his friend, and she directed him to sit down beside her daughter, and they were regarded as man and wife.

It was noticed, however, that Monedowa himself ate but little, and that of a peculiar kind of meat, flavored with berries, which, with other circumstances, convinced them that he was not as the Indian people around him.

In a few days his mother-in-law told him that the manito would come to pay them a visit, to see how the young man, her son, prospered.

Monedowa answered that he should on that day be absent. When the time arrived, he flew upon a tall tree, overlooking the lodge, and took his station there as the wicked manito passed in.

The mudjee monedo cast sharp glances at the scaffolds so well laden with meat, and as soon as he had entered, he said, ""Why, who is it that is furnishing you with meat so plentifully?""

The widow excused herself by saying that she did not think it necessary to tell him, inasmuch as he was a manito, and must have known before he asked.

The manito was very pleasant with Monedowa, and after much other discourse, in a gentle-spoken voice, he invited him to the racing-ground, saying it was a manly amusement, that he would have an excellent chance to meet there with other warriors, and that he should himself be pleased to run with him.
